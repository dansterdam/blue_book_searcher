  "main event": "On January 5th, 1954, near Tooma, N.S.W., Australia, two witnesses observed three circular or oval high-intensity light objects weaving about in flight, each maintaining its intensity as it moved towards the west. The observation lasted for 10-15 minutes, and the witnesses used polaroid glasses to aid their observation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed at an angle of 120 degrees elevation above the horizon to the east and rose to 350 degrees before disappearing at 180 degrees.",
    "One of the witnesses had considerable experience of aircraft spotting in the Navy and used the extended arm and thumb method to judge angles.",
    "The observation was made by two witnesses, and there was a third alleged observer who was not interviewed.",
    "The objects were initially seen in the east, maneuvered, and then disappeared in a southerly direction.",
    "Polaroid glasses were reported to be much more effective than the naked eye for observation, especially in comparison to passing aircraft later on, where the difference was not as marked."
