  "main event": "Multiple sightings of a blue unidentified flying object were reported on January 21, 1956, over the Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. The object was observed at an altitude of 29000 feet, and its size was estimated to be at least 15 miles.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was initially thought to be a falling star but appeared to be a brightly illuminated circular object, rotating and oscillating about a center.",
    "After conferring to assure continued visual observation, the object made an abrupt change of direction and accelerated before disappearing about 3 seconds later.",
    "The object's eccentric motion was unlike that of any known astronomical object, and it left a pulsating light trail about five times the length of the object.",
    "The observer hesitated to estimate the distance to the object but suggested it could be around 20 miles distant.",
    "A Danish Second Mate with 15 years' experience at sea likened the object's flight to the tracks of V-2 rockets, which he had seen during the war."
