    "main event": "Three military observers on Shemya Air Force Station in Alaska sighted a variable-shaped object that changed colors from red to green to white at 2-second intervals for over 30 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to move in a square pattern, sometimes moving up and down, and a bright flash similar to a camera flash was observed.",
        "The object was observed for two periods, first for 38 minutes and later for 3 minutes, as it disappeared and reappeared due to clouds.",
        "A Navy P3V aircraft on routine patrol was asked to search the area but did not observe anything unusual.",
        "This sighting was similar to a previous UFO report from King Salmon Air Force Station on October 19th, where a single object exhibiting the same color-changing behavior was observed.",
        "The King Salmon sighting was analyzed as potentially being an astronomical observation, and the Shemya sighting was also concluded to be consistent with an astronomical object."
