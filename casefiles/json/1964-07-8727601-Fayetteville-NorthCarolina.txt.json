    "main event": "A bright, white light the size of a pinhead was observed moving erratically in the sky over North Carolina on July 21, 1964.",
    "interesting points": "The object was first observed at an elevation of 75-80 degrees and an azimuth of 130 degrees, and was last seen disappearing over a cloud bank on the northeast horizon. The object's flight path was normal except when overhead, when it dipped slowly down and then appeared to speed up. The object was observed for 6 minutes using ground-based visual sightings with 3.2x32 power binoculars. Similar objects were observed on multiple occasions in the Winston-Salem, North Carolina area between July 14 and July 20, 1964, moving in a northeast direction at various elevations. The chief intelligence division's analysis was that the object was likely a satellite, but they were unable to account for the erratic movements.",
