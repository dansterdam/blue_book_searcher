        "A third sighting was of a bright, white light that appeared larger than a star, remained stationary for about 15 minutes, then moved off at a high rate of speed.",
        "The reports indicate that these sightings were made by mature, reliable observers, including someone associated with a known military activity.",
        "The Air Force's Project Blue Book program investigated these sightings, but concluded there was 'insufficient data for evaluation' in most cases due to lack of details."
