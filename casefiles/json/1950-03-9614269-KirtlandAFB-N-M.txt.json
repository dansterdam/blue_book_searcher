		"The 'saucers' filled the sky, moving erratically and at incredible speeds, in what was described as 'the greatest exhibition of magnetic flight.'",
		"The explanation for one of the sightings was a burst Skyhook balloon, which disintegrated into hundreds of tiny pieces of plastic, causing a saucer scare.",
		"One report described a metallic, disc-shaped object of approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter, which was observed to be stationary before rapidly accelerating and disappearing from sight.",
		"The objects were observed by experienced tower operators, ruling out known types of aircraft or weather balloons.",
		"The Air Intelligence Officer considered the sightings important enough to warrant immediate transmission to higher headquarters."
