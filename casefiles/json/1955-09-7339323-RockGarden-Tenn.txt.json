    "main event": "On September 9th, 1955 in Rock Garden, Tennessee, an illuminated circular object about 100 feet in diameter, described as a 'square, brownish' object, was observed moving in a circular motion at a slow speed. It eventually moved off to the Northeast behind trees and over the horizon.",
    "interesting points": [
        "Immediate action was taken to investigate the report, involving military and civilian organizations, but no further information was obtained.",
        "Despite two military and three civilian aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting, negative reports were received regarding these aircraft.",
        "Weather conditions at the time of the sighting were clear, with good visibility, and no weather balloons were released in the immediate area.",
        "The preparing officer suggested that the sighting might suggest some type of aircraft or balloon, yet ruled out the possibility of it being a weather balloon due to its slow rate of speed and the absence of observation on radar screens.",
        "An interesting point is the change in the witness's description of the object from 'almost square' in the preliminary investigation to 'pointed like a rocket' with 'stubby wings' in the following investigation, leading to doubts about the reliability of the report."
