  "main event": "On 15 July 1954 at Hamilton AFB, California, a ground-radar observation reported a brilliant white and orange light resembling the exhaust of a jet, possibly of conical shape, exhibiting rapid, bright, colorful changes during flight. The observation lasted for 5 minutes, with the object exhibiting noticeable behavior during diving and abrupt changes in flight direction.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observation was made by a reliable and trustworthy individual with 364 flying hours (276 jet hours) and no combat time.",
    "The object was observed to exhibit conical exhaust-like behavior, notably during diving and abrupt changes in flight.",
    "Two sightings were made by the same pilot, with the only change being the difference in elevation and azimuth. The pilot's analysis was inconclusive, pending further investigation.",
    "The observation was considered possibly a balloon, aircraft, or astronomical due to insufficient data for evaluation.",
    "The report was sent to multiple Air Force commands and headquarters for further analysis."
