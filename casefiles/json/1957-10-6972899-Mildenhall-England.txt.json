    "main event": "On October 17, 1957, a circular disc-shaped object was observed in Mildenhall, England, for approximately 20 minutes. The object was silent, stationary, grey in color, with portholes or openings around the edge, and showed no exhaust or trail with no accompanying sound.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter and made no sound, and no exhaust or source of propulsion was observed.",
        "The object disappeared from view by rapidly accelerating and climbing at a steep angle.",
        "The report includes a statement from two United States Air Force pilots who observed a bright silver disc-shaped object emitting no exhaust or flame near Mildenhall, England, for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Weather conditions were good and the sky was clear, and the object maintained a steady course and altitude.",
        "Another observation described a circular object with changing shades of light, hovering west of the airfield in Mildenhall, England, for 10 minutes. The object was reported to emanate a brighter light in the center, pulsating, and seemed to be under intelligent control.",
        "Despite a weather radar reporting two separate objects, only one object was tracked locally, and positive identification could not be made. The characteristics of the object did not match those associated with usual types of aircraft or missile."
