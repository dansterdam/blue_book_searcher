        "Weather conditions at the time included clear skies, a slight temperature inversion, and winds around 20-28 knots.",
        "The Bangor Daily News reported numerous sightings of the object on the same night, stating it was visible from Portland.",
        "The Air Force concluded the sighting was possibly a balloon or aircraft, but the object's behavior (vertical descent, high-speed horizontal movement) was not typical of known aerial vehicles at the time."
