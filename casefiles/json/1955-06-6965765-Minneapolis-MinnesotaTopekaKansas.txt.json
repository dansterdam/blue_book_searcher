    "main event": "On June 15, 1955, a brilliant green object, resembling the size of a grapefruit at arm's length, was observed in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Topeka, Kansas. It displayed an unusual behavior of snapping to a stop, hovering, and then suddenly accelerating and disappearing. Small pieces seemed to have fallen from the main body of the object.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object displayed a brilliant green color, turning to red, and had a tail behind it, resembling the size and appearance of those on the moon.",
        "It was observed for about 1 minute before accelerating and disappearing suddenly.",
        "A similar sighting occurred at Topeka, Kansas a few minutes later, displaying the same characteristics.",
        "Both sightings were evaluated as possibly astronomical with no further investigation.",
        "The observations were made by credible sources such as a military pilot and a weather jet pilot."
