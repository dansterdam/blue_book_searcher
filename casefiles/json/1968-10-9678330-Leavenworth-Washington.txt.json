        "The lights moved erratically, with some testimony that there may have been more than three lights, but the exact number was difficult to count due to their fast movement.",
        "The lights appeared to have some means of propulsion, with plumes behind them that were part of the object itself.",
        "The lights changed colors, transitioning from reddish-green to bright white and then to orange.",
        "The lights would suddenly speed up, rush away, and then disappear and reappear."
