    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to fire a small object that was observed to the rear of the main object at an approximate speed of 1,000 miles per hour for approximately 2 to 3 seconds before the object distinguished into a ball of fire.",
        "The ATIC contract astronomer stated that the object observed was a meteor, and the fact that the object appeared to climb was probably caused by the motion of the aircraft as it turned to avoid collision.",
        "The report concludes that the object was astronomical (a meteor).",
        "The pilot was certain the object was not a star, planet, or any known type of aircraft or celestial body, and it was not affected by cloud cover encountered during the sighting.",
