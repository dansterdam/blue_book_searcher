  "main event": "On 22 September 1955, in San Antonio, Texas, a round, white object, the size of a basketball, was observed hovering and moving over Kelly Air Force Base. It was intensely bright and appeared similar to an electric welder's arc. Several exhausts were observed emanating from the outer edge of the object, making it move counter-clockwise. The object remained in sight for approximately 10 to 15 minutes before disappearing. The report concluded that it was probably a balloon, with insufficient data for a reliable analysis and an inconclusive evaluation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was intensely bright and the size of a nickel held at arm's length, later growing to the size of a basketball as it got closer.",
    "Multiple exhausts were seen emanating from the outer edge of the object, causing it to move in a counter-clockwise direction.",
    "The duration of the observation was approximately 10 minutes, during which the object made erratic movements before disappearing.",
    "The reliability of the sighting was rated as good, with a 3/10 score, and the source was visual clouds encountered in meteorological, astronomical, or otherwise which make account of the sighting.",
    "The chief of the Base Security Division at Kelly AFB, Texas, considered the nature of the sighting as unidentified, with no definite action taken and no physical evidence found."
