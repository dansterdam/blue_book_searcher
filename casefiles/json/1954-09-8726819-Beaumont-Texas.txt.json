  "main event": "A civilian report from Beaumont, Texas on September 19, 1954, documented a silver object moving slowly, stationary at 30-40,000 ft, with no radar pick-up. The conclusion was that it was probably a balloon.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting involved a silver object that appeared to be stationary at a high altitude, and it was not detected on radar.",
    "The report suggests that it may have been a possible balloon sighting, indicating a prosaic explanation for the UFO.",
    "Another observation by a military air control tower operator in Beaumont, Texas on September 6, 1954, described a bright object with red light moving very slowly.",
    "The bright object was observed traveling straight and level at an altitude of 22 to 27 thousand feet, and was obscured by clouds.",
    "A Project Blue Book record from January 27, 1954, reported a bright star-like object that later appeared to resemble the fuselage of an aircraft, with no sound and high brightness."
