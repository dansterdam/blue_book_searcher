    "main event": "A witness observed a fast-moving, oval or circular-shaped metallic object in the sky over Coloma, Michigan on April 27, 1962.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object suddenly 'shacked' (shook) and then rapidly moved away, leading the witness to initially think it was an aircraft that had crashed in the woods.",
        "The witness was unable to determine any additional details or characteristics of the object due to its high speed.",
        "Another witness reported seeing two bright fireballs, one larger than the other, traveling at a much faster speed than a plane on the same date.",
        "The report suggests the UFO was likely a re-entering satellite or meteorite based on the sudden shaking motion and rapid disappearance.",
        "The sighting lasted for approximately 5-7 minutes."
