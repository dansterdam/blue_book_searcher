    "main event": "According to the document, the witness saw a long, luminous object traveling at high speed from west to east, which split into parts and continued going east before disappearing into the mist.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object moved without a sound and was traveling at a tremendous pace.",
        "The object split into parts as it moved, but it was unclear if they were two different objects or if the original object just split up.",
        "The witness was an amateur astronomer and had never seen anything like this before.",
        "The witness initially saw an unusually bright, warm glow in the east, which was unusual for the time of day.",
        "The witness was unsure if the object could be a satellite, as they questioned whether satellites can travel from east to west rather than being aimed toward the earth."
