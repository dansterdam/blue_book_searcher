  "main event": "On October 13, 1956, at Wheelus Air Base in Libya, two bright and shiny objects were observed at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet, traveling at a speed of about 3000 mph and making several changes in direction. Ground radar and air intercept radar tracked the objects for 3-4 minutes before the final contact was lost at 0650Z.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed at a high altitude of 30,000 feet and traveling at an extreme speed of about 3000 mph.",
    "Both ground radar and air intercept radar tracked the objects, adding credibility to the sighting.",
    "The objects made several changes in direction, indicating advanced maneuverability beyond conventional aircraft capabilities.",
    "The disparity between the visual sightings and radar presentations is noted, raising the possibility of a unique atmospheric phenomenon or unidentified objects.",
    "The report mentioned the unlikelihood of birds maintaining a given course for such a long period of time, dismissing the possibility of birds accounting for the radar returns."
