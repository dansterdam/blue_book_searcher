    "main event": "Seven stationary objects in a W formation were observed in the sky over Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 15, 1965.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were the size of a basketball at arm's length and had the color of a pale full moon.",
        "The objects were perfectly round and did not have any trails or sounds.",
        "The witness initially thought the objects were the sun behind clouds, but the sun should have been higher in the sky at that time of day.",
        "The objects disappeared as the clouds covering them dissipated, only visible for about 3 seconds.",
        "The report suggests the objects were most likely a reflection of the sun or a weather balloon."
