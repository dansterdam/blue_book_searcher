One sighting described an oval-shaped object emitting a pale blue-green light and hovering for approximately 30-45 minutes before speeding away at a high rate of speed.

    "A local astronomer agreed that one of the sightings was a meteor, adding a scientific perspective to the investigation.",
    "Observations of flashing lights in the sky were reported by mariners, indicating a wider geographical scope of the unidentified objects.",
    "The observed objects exhibited characteristics such as hovering, rapid acceleration, and emitting colored light, which are unusual for conventional aircraft or natural phenomena."
