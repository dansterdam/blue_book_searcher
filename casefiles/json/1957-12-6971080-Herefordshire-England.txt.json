    "main event": "On 22 December 1957, in Herefordshire, England, a civilian observed a small, light bluish-white object that eventually disappeared. The observation lasted for around 5 seconds, and the source claimed to have seen flying lights close together in formation for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The observed object was described as smaller in size and was compared to a Verey pistol before disappearing from sight.",
        "The report suggested the possibility of the object being a balloon, satellite, or astronomical meteor due to prominent similar phenomena at that time of year.",
        "There was a mention of a light whine sound and the possibility of military aircraft or fireball-like phenomena being the cause of the sighting.",
        "A letter from the USAF Project Blue Book division discussed the sighting, mentioning that the object observed could have been a balloon or rehash, coinciding with the sighting after the report writer finished Keyhoe's book on flying saucers.",
        "Questions also included details about the observer's location, the appearance of the object, its movement, any noise it made, and the presence of lights."
