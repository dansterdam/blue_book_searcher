  "main event": "Miss -------------, a housekeeper, along with a salesman and a housewife, witnessed 50-60 shiny, small, unknown objects, possibly like a meteor, moving at extremely high speeds, faster than any known aircraft, in an easterly direction in Memphis, Tennessee on May 7, 1948. Most of the objects traveled in a straight line, with some zig-zagging slightly. No sound was heard, and some objects seemed to have a silvery tail, possibly an exhaust trail.",
