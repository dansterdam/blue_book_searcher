  "main event": "On 28 June 1947, a military pilot sighted 5 or 6 white, circular objects flying in a close formation at an estimated speed of 285 MPH and an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet, 30 miles northwest of Lake Meade, Nevada.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were flying smoothly and in a close formation, with an estimated size of approximately 36\" in diameter.",
    "The pilot was certain that the objects were not birds or conventional aircraft, as he had experience flying both types.",
    "The report suggests a high-speed motion of the objects, indicating that it was unlikely to be astronomical or conventional aircraft.",
    "The objects were observed at a relatively high altitude of 10,000 feet and were not accompanied by any physical evidence or exhaust trails.",
    "According to the witness, the observed motion of the objects was only apparent, possibly indicating a reflection of the motion of the plane."
