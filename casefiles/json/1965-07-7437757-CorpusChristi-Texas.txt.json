    "interesting points": [
        "The objects appeared to be maneuvering slowly with no observable features, and the maneuvers were erratic, lasting 15-20 minutes.",
        "The objects were not attached to any fast cosmic flight and maneuvered as a balloon would, with no trails or shadows observed.",
        "The objects' flight was in accord with balloon drifting motions, and no radar returns were detected.",
        "The objects disappeared on a heading of 200 degrees.",
        "The dry air aloft and lack of inversions suggested the objects were not conventional aircraft."
