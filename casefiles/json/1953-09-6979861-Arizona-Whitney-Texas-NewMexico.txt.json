"interesting points": [
"The object was reported to emit a single pulsating jet type blue flame at an estimated altitude of 15 to 23 thousand feet and a speed of over 500 mph. It was observed by a Navy gator and verified by a U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel.",
"The object was described as a very bright silvery object, almost twice the size of a DC-3 aircraft, climbing at a steep angle and moving at a high rate of speed.",
"Reports from various competent civil and military observers described high-speed maneuverable objects over the southwestern U.S., with intense white lights and apparent speed of more than 15,000 mph, similar to exhaust of aircraft or missile tests.",
"No definite explanation has been established for this observation, and a total lack of detailed information on flight path, size, shape, and color of the object was noted, making further analysis of the report difficult.",
"The report included a detailed questionnaire to gather information about the observation, such as the time, location, duration, sky conditions, and position of the sun in relation to the sighting."
