  "main event": "On September 29, 1957, an observer flying at 24,000 ft over the Atlantic Ocean, 275 miles E. of Cape Cod, Mass, saw a brilliant white light appear at the 5 o'clock position and approach his aircraft at a high rate of speed. The light then suddenly disappeared after approaching within 1/2 mile of the aircraft, brilliantly illuminating the cockpit.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The duration of the observation was 115 seconds, during which the cockpit of the aircraft was brilliantly illuminated by the light.",
    "The report suggests that the sighting was possibly a balloon, aircraft, or astronomical phenomenon, but the conclusion was confirmed unidentifiable with insufficient data for evaluation.",
    "The two observing officers, including Captain Edward Peterson with 13 years of rated pilot experience, stated that the sighting was different from any falling star or comet they had previously sighted.",
    "The observed objects resembled moving specks of light resembling stars, traveling on a heading of approximately 342 degrees true.",
    "No photographs were present in the report, and the conclusion was that the sighting was satisfactorily explained, possibly by a meteorite."
