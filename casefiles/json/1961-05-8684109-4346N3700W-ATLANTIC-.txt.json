Unfortunately, the text provided does not contain enough detailed information to generate a comprehensive JSON summary. The report appears to be a very brief and limited Project Blue Book record card with minimal details about the sighting. 

Based on the information available, here is a summary in the requested format:

{
    "main event": "Two unidentified objects were observed in the Atlantic Ocean.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were described as white, spherical shapes.",
        "The objects remained stationary in the sky for 5-10 minutes.",
        "The sighting occurred on an overcast day.",
        "The sighting was from the perspective of a military Ranger.",
        "Very little additional information is provided in the record card."
    ],
    "result": "unexplained",
    "sighted object": "two white, spherical objects",
    "location": "Atlantic Ocean, 34°00'N 70°00'W",
    "witnesses": "military Ranger",
    "photographs": "no"
}

Please note that the "interesting points" section is limited due to the sparse details provided in the source material. Without more comprehensive information, I cannot generate a more detailed summary.
