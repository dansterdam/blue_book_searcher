  "interesting points": [
    "The object was about the size of a baseball and gave off a steady glow with no sound heard.",
    "The observer mentioned that the weather was clear and the object was visible against a clear sky.",
    "A report from June 15, 1959, mentioned that sun striking the lens, possibly with water droplets on the lens element, was the most reasonable explanation for the image observed at Waikiki, Hawaii.",
    "There was an evaluation of a color slide of a UFO and it was inconclusive rather than diagnostic, with possible causes including specular reflection or refraction, reflection from a glass window, double exposure, and developing flaws.",
    "A UFO sighting report from November 16, 1959, described an individual aboard a ship taking two rolls of film, which later showed a disc-shaped object, and the original photographic negative was not sent."
