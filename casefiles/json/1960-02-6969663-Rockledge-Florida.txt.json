        "The objects were described as brilliantly-lighted and able to maintain a suspended position, then rapidly dart away in a zig-zag manner.",
        "The brightness of the lights was so intense that it illuminated the entire countryside within a half-mile radius.",
        "The observer, a Rockledge resident, was in a car with four other witnesses when they encountered the unusual objects.",
        "The observer stated that the altitude, speed, and maneuvers of the objects were unexplainable to them.",
        "The Air Force initially concluded the sighting was probably of balloons or birds, but the observer disagreed with this assessment based on the objects' behavior."
