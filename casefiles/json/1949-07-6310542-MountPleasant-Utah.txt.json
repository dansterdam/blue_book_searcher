  "main event": "Two unidentified silver or white objects were observed by an Air Force pilot and a co-pilot 10 miles east of Mount Pleasant, Utah, at 9000 feet above sea level, flying at excessive speed in comparison with the aircraft, with an elapsed time of visual sighting of 3 seconds. None of the other crew members saw the objects.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting involved two indistinguishable objects that were flying at a high speed in comparison with the aircraft.",
    "The objects were observed by an Air Force pilot and co-pilot, adding credibility to the report.",
    "There were no photographs or sketches of the objects' configuration available, adding to the mystery.",
    "The objects were sighted at a specific location and time, under clear weather conditions (CAVU), adding to the credibility of the observation.",
    "Despite the high speed and maneuverability of the objects, there was no sound or exhaust trail observed, which is unconventional for aircraft or known man-made objects."
