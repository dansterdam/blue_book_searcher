    "main event": "Two Air Force pilots on an air intercept mission locked onto a UFO.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The target showed an erratic course with turns at approximately right angles, and its performance approximated that of a modern jet aircraft.",
        "During the intercept, the target was executing evasive maneuvers.",
        "The reported speed of the target as it went out in excess (over 1200 knots) may have been due to the interceptor's radar jumping lock.",
        "The elevation angles of the target as it was going out in range at 1200 knots were considered to be approximate, as the true elevation angle was not accurately indicated.",
        "The crew of the interceptor aircraft reported that the target return was steady for the full period of scope coverage."
