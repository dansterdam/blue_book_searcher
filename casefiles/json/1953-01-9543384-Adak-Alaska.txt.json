        "Another report described a large luminous object changing shape from round to oblong, maneuvering in the sky without sound, and then disappearing behind the mountains.",
        "In the Adak, Alaska incident, a bluish spherical light with a tapering tail was observed moving rapidly at a tremendous speed and at a great distance, persisting for 3 seconds.",
        "One report suggested that the object observed could have been a UAFC (Unidentified Aerial Flying Craft) rather than a UFO, indicating the possibility of unidentifiable terrestrial origin.",
