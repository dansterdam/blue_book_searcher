    "main event": "On 11 June 1949 at 2057 local time in Los Alamos, New Mexico, a civilian observer reported a sighting of a green object that turned red at the end of its flight, resembling a star or light. The object appeared to climb sharply and then fell almost straight down in a 4 to 5-second observation.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed to change color from green to red at the end of its flight, leaving a short red tail behind. This behavior is atypical for a conventional aircraft or celestial body.",
        "The estimated altitude of the object was approximately 25 degrees with an apparent size of a star, indicating that it was relatively high in the sky.",
        "The observer stated that the object did not appear to be a meteor due to its color and flight path, suggesting that it exhibited unusual characteristics.",
        "The observation took place in clear weather, just after good darkness, providing optimal visibility for the event.",
        "The observer, identified as an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Security Inspector, was deemed to have met the requirements for employment, implying a credible and reliable witness."
