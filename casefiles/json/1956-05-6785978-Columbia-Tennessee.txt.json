  "main event": "On May 20, 1956, in Columbia, Tennessee, a civilian observer reported sighting four or more oblong, flat, circular metallic objects hovering in a cluster, reflecting sunlight off their metallic surfaces and moving up and down and sideways between two banks of clouds. The objects were seen for three to four minutes before vanishing into thin air.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were described as silvery metallic, circular and flat in shape, and emitting flashing light off their metallic surfaces.",
    "The duration of the sighting was three to four minutes, providing a substantial observation period.",
    "The altitude of the objects was estimated to be between 20,000 to 30,000 feet, indicating a high altitude presence.",
    "The report was deemed to possibly be caused by a cluster of balloons, and there was negative radar contact with the objects.",
    "The report was immediately forwarded to radar sites, and interception or identification action was not taken despite a nearby jet flow."
