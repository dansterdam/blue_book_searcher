  "main event": "On January 3, 1958, in Harbor Springs, Michigan, a circular object was observed by a civilian, displaying rapidly changing colors in the order of green, red, orange, and white. The observation lasted for 3 minutes as the object traveled from northeast to southwest.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The conclusion suggested that the observer probably saw an incoherent S/V handling with illumination like that of a flashbulb, indicating a mundane explanation for the sighting.",
    "The report describes the observed object as completely alien to any logical, scientific, conventional, or psychological comparisons and moving at a tremendous speed in irregular and erratic motions.",
    "Three witnesses corroborated the visual observation, all in direct agreement about the specific details observed, and none of them had prior experience or interest in this type of phenomena.",
    "The report highlights the completely unexplainable nature of the observed phenomena, defying any reasonable logical explanation based on the unanimous observation and description.",
    "The sighting was part of Project 10073, a program by the United States Air Force that investigated unidentified flying objects (UFOs)."
