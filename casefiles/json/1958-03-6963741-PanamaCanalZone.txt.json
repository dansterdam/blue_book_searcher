  "main event": "On 9-10 March 1958 in the Panama Canal Zone, two brilliant white light sources, generally triangular in shape, were observed moving with variable speed at a high altitude. The sighting lasted approximately 3 minutes and the objects appeared to be flying very high, with definite movement observed.",
  "interesting points": [
    "Radar scopes showed unexplained objects at various times, exhibiting strong and easily discernible returns from normal aircraft returns.",
    "Commercial flight voluntarily investigated two of the targets and confirmed their existence, ruling out the possibility of weather balloons.",
    "One radar contact was made at a position approximately 1200 miles East of COLON, Panama, and the radar contact compared with RCA radar.",
    "One of the observed objects exhibited rapid movement, with an estimated speed of 1600 to 2700 miles per hour, ruling out the possibility of weather balloons.",
    "Major Dewys reported observing a UFO and made efforts to investigate, indicating an official attempt to verify the sighting."
