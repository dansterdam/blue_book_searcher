    "main event": "A resident of Bloomfield, Connecticut observed a round, silvery-white object in the sky on January 4, 1960.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was estimated to be about as large as the moon and moved across the sky from southwest to northeast at a relatively slow speed of around 35 mph.",
        "The object was observed for approximately 15 minutes before disappearing from view.",
        "After the object disappeared, the witness heard a low rumbling sound that lasted about 5 seconds, which may have been a distant truck or unrelated to the sighting.",
        "The witness did not discount the possibility that the object was a satellite, missile, or some other natural phenomenon, but could not definitively identify it.",
        "The report contains a detailed description of the object's appearance, motion, and the witness's actions during the sighting."
