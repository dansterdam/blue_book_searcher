The object was described as an oval shape and was sighted three times, appearing brighter on subsequent sightings and exhibiting erratic movements. The report included photographs and indicated a sighting duration of 2-3 minutes with only one object observed. The object's course was from south to north, and intelligence reports suggested that the sighting may have been caused by a searchlight reflection off low cloud layers.",
