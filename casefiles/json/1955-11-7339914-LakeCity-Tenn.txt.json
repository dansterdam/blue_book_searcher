    "main event": "Multiple sightings of unidentified objects were reported in Lake City and Alexandria, Tennessee on various dates in 1955. Witnesses included radar operators, a telephone company manager, and military personnel. The objects were described as oval-shaped, silvery, yellow, and bright orange in color, with erratic flight patterns and high speeds. The sightings lasted from a few minutes to over 20 minutes, and no regular reporting channels could determine the cause for the sightings. Interceptors were scrambled after visual observation, but no identification was made on the objects.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were described as oval-shaped, bright orange, and silvery, with no discernible shape or internal details. Witnesses compared their size and brightness to an aircraft, a half-dollar coin, or a football field at arm's length.",
        "Some witnesses observed the objects flying at 10 miles apart, approximately 25 miles away, and estimated the speed to be 600+ MPH.",
        "The objects were observed to travel in a straight path, fade from sight, and disappear at a great distance, with erratic flight patterns and the ability to gain or lose elevation.",
        "Multiple investigative efforts were made, including checks with weather stations and flight services, as well as radar tracking and scrambling of aircraft after the objects. However, no regular reporting channels could determine the cause for the sightings.",
        "The commanding officer believed that the larger deduction for the sighting was more possible than other solutions, and it was eventually concluded that the sighting was probably caused by viewing the planet Venus through temperature inversions."
