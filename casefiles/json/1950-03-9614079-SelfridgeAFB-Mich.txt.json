    "interesting points": [
        "The object was tracked by radar traveling at speeds up to 1500 mph and altitudes up to 45,000 feet.",
        "The document notes changes in the object's altitude and speed, and describes it as \"erratic\".",
        "The object was later visually observed by the crew, rapidly changing altitudes.",
        "The radar returns were similar to a C-47 aircraft, but the maneuvers were beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft.",
        "The frequency of such reports had recently increased, leading to instructions for all radar installations to report unidentified object sightings."
