"main event": "On November 13, 1957, a round object changing from bright white, the size of a silver dollar to a basketball, was observed in Hopkins and St. Paul, Minnesota. The object moved in a specific manner and was initially mistaken for Venus due to its proximity to Earth.",
"interesting points": [
	"The object's brightness was measured at 25-45 degrees from the horizon, moving to the southwest and then stopping at specific intervals.",
	"The observation lasted for 30 seconds and was classified as a ground-visual sighting, with additional reports from the control tower of an aircraft in the area.",
	"The report raises concerns about the public excitement caused by the close proximity of Venus to the Earth, potentially leading to misidentifications.",
	"An astronomical plot later confirmed that Venus was in the reported location, indicating a probable misidentification of the celestial object.",
	"The preliminary analysis suggests that the object could have been a star, considering the time and location of the sighting."
