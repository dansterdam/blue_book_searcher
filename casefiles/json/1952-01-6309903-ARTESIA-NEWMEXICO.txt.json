  "main event": "On January 16, 1952, in Artesia, New Mexico, two members of a balloon project and four civilians observed two unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of the balloon they were observing. The objects were spherical or circular in shape, and were observed at altitudes of 30,000 ft. and 20,000 ft.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed twice, once from Artesia, New Mexico, and once from the Artesia Airport.",
    "The observations included one round object moving in an arc and two objects flying side-by-side, circling the balloon, or seemingly so.",
    "The observers, including two members of a balloon project, four civilians, and Mrs. Randall, a civilian, saw the objects and described them as unlike any conventional aircraft.",
    "The report was not made until April 5, 1952, resulting in a time lapse that prevented further investigation.",
    "The observed objects exhibited unusual behavior, such as making sudden changes in direction and speed, and were noted to be travelling at very high speeds."
