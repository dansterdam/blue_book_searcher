  "main event": "On 21st November 1957, in Visc, Chocalaite Mt., north of Yuma, Arizona, two elongated, illuminated objects were observed at very high altitude for 60 minutes. The objects were initially X-shaped and had vertical lights, leading to speculation of being a military aircraft, but insufficient data prevented an evaluation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were initially observed as X-shaped and later reported as being pear-shaped, the size of a small pear, and silver in color.",
    "The observation was considered to be purely chance, with the aircraft flying directly underneath the object and no noticeable movement for 25 minutes.",
    "The report involved visual observation from an aircraft flying around 35,200 feet underneath the object, and clear visual and radar tracks were obtained.",
    "A high-ranking female officer from the US Navy and USAF had evaluated the observation.",
    "The chief director of the 554th ACWRON believed the object to be a high-altitude balloon of the Sky Hook type."
