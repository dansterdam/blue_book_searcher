  "main event": "On May 25, 1954, at around 10:45 a.m. near Shawnee Mission, Kansas, a bright, silvery, disc-shaped object was observed hovering, then disappeared at high speed. Three pilots from the Royal New Zealand Air Force also reported seeing oval, electrically powered, soundless objects flying in formation at a high speed.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as bright, lit up, solid, silvery, and disc-shaped, and appeared to be low-flying before disappearing rapidly into the distance.",
    "Pilots witnessed oval, electrically powered objects flying in formation at a high speed, completely silent and with shiny mirror-like appearance.",
    "Police in Kansas City reported observing objects moving at incredible speed, first thought to be aircraft engaged in a routine military exercise, but details such as altitude and speed were unobtainable as the objects were visible for only about 4 minutes.",
    "Three pilots from the Royal New Zealand Air Force described the objects as appearing suddenly, then disappearing, and were unable to ascertain whether they were moving. The objects were oval, looked like shiny mirrors, and were observed flying in formation at a much higher altitude than the pilots' 7,000-foot flight level.",
    "An official report from an airline navigator on a B-47 bomber described a bright light that was stationary for about 2 minutes before disappearing."
