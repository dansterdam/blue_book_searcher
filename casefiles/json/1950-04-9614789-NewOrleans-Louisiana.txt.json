    "The object was completely silent and passed through 15 degrees of arc in 10 seconds.",
    "There were multiple observers and sightings on different dates, including sketching the formation of grouping and direction of the object's disappearance.",
    "Another sighting on 15 April 1950 described a dark orange or red object approximately three feet in diameter, appearing completely round and shaped like a ball, at an altitude of approximately 300 feet moving from northwest to southwest.",
    "The object sighted on 27 April 1950 was reported to be sailing steadily toward the shore of Lake Pontchartrain, gradually losing altitude until it landed, then hesitated and shot straight up and disappeared very rapidly.",
    "One of the witnesses in Baton Rouge noted that the observed bright light in the sky was continuous and did not believe it to be the light of a plane."
