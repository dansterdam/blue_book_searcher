    "main event": "A group of civilians in Benson, Arizona reported a bright object moving rapidly across the sky, which appeared brighter than any star but less bright than the planet Venus. The sighting lasted approximately 35-50 minutes, and local newspaper articles at the time mentioned similar UFO sightings in the area.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The estimated minimum height of the unknown object over the observer's location was calculated to reflect sunlight at 1827, with a detailed diagram and mathematical calculations provided to support the estimation.",
        "A photograph showing a diagram related to the size and height of the unidentified object was included in the document, along with calculations based on the assumption of parallel light rays arriving from the sun.",
        "The object was observed to leave a long trail of sparks behind it, and witnesses suggested that it may have been a fireball associated with a known meteor shower, although its trajectory, size, speed, and duration of observation did not fit the characteristics of a conventional plane or known artificial satellite.",
        "An Aerobee rocket experiment carried out by the Air Force showed that artificial meteors from an exploding rocket can be detected by radar and that the bright glow of these objects attracted scientists to experiment with film and a ballistic camera.",
        "Local scientists considered the possibility of the unidentified object being an artificial satellite due to its trajectory of travel, size, speed, and duration of observation, but there were no known artificial satellites at that time capable of the performance exhibited by the object."
