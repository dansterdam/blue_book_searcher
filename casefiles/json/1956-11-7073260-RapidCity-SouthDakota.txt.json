    "main event": "On 5th November 1956 in Rapid City, South Dakota, an unusual meteor sighting was observed. The object appeared to be shaped like a flame from a jet afterburner, colored blue, slightly larger than a disto cannon, and appeared to move in a zigzag path before suddenly pulling up and disappearing.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The sighting lasted for 8 to 10 seconds and the object was observed flying at a very high altitude path, except for a sharp pull-up at the end of the observation when the light went out.",
        "The object was described as shaped like a plain fruit basket with an afterburner glow and changed from a blue color at the leading edge to orange-colored sparks.",
        "The report was submitted with a conclusion of 'unidentified', and the witness, who had seven years of service in the Air Force, was convinced that the object was not caused by atmospheric conditions or a meteor.",
        "The witness's description of the sighting was compared to a jet against the sunset, but it was noted that the object could not have made the observed movements in less than 10 seconds.",
        "The report was official, but there were concerns about the propriety of publicizing it, and it was noted to be the subject of command policy."
