  "main event": "On the night of April 16, 1954, a civilian in Honolulu, Oahu observed a brilliant red light-like object hovering over the ocean, remaining stationary for about one and a half minutes before speeding off towards the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station with a tail of light resembling a comet's tail. This was followed by the loss of radar contact and no corroborating reports or credible explanations for the sighting.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed at an approximate altitude of 3000-4000 feet over the ocean between China and Lanai.",

    "Weather conditions and radar confirmations did not provide a prosaic explanation for the sighting.",
    "There were no corroborating reports or credible explanations for the observed phenomena.",
    "The observation was also supported by reports from Pearl Harbor Rescue and the U.S. Weather Station at Kaneohe International Airport."
