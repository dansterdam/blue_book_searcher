    "The object seemed to move in a unique manner, turning toward the east with distinct changes in brightness and shape, resembling a large comet with tails before fading away.",
    "The observer, familiar with astronomical phenomena, ruled out the possibility of it being a meteor, display of aurora borealis, or a comet, and described it as something quite normal of occurrence.",
    "Despite the observer's belief that it might be a normal occurrence, the distinct maneuvers and characteristics of the object left the observer uncertain of its nature.",
    "The observer was alerted to the object by moderate light, and the sighting took place in dark, moonless, misty weather, with bright starlight."
