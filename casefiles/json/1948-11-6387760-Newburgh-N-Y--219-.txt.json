  "main event": "On November 29, 1948, a 14-year-old girl reported seeing a large red ball with a long tail, which she believed to be a blue-tailed comet, traveling from east to west in Newburgh, New York.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as a slow-moving fireball, similar to solid meteorites, by the officials.",
    "The sighting coincided with the release of a USAF rawinsonde and a pilot balloon sounding, indicating possible alternative explanations such as a burning balloon or an aerostar.",
    "The object's movement from east to west was deemed impossible for a balloon due to westerly winds at all levels.",
    "An incident summary from the Air Weather Service suggested the need for a change in the guide to investigation of UFOs to clarify the direction of flight of objects and include statements about relative radar positioning.",
    "Evaluation of sightings by Dr. Hynek included high, half, or low probabilities of astronomical or non-astronomical explanations for the reported objects."
