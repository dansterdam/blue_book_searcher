    "main event": "A round, spinning object with a humming sound, about 100 feet in diameter and metallic in color, was observed near San Jose, California.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be traveling at a high speed, making turns and at times stopping, hovering, and then accelerating in a straight line after reaching altitude.",
        "Witnesses said the object appeared from nowhere and took off and disappeared in a split second.",
        "The observation could not be explained and was classified as an 'unidentable report' due to the lack of further data or evidence to determine the nature of the sighting.",
        "No physical evidence or photographs were available.",
        "The duty officer reported the entire report was sketchy due to direction confusion of the reporting person, and it was possibly a reflection of an advertising searchlight or sighting of scattered status clouds."
