    "interesting points": [
        "The objects appeared to be two distinct entities close to the camera, with light intensities much greater than the sky background, indicating they were in close proximity.",
        "The objects were reported to have existed only momentarily and then moved on and disappeared.",
        "The photo analysis concluded that the objects were likely a double image of reflected sunlight off some object in front of the camera's windshield, possibly a vapor trail.",
        "The analysis suggested the identical double image could have been caused by a reflection from the front and rear of the windshield glass.",
        "The witness reported the objects gradually disappeared in a slow fading out manner."
