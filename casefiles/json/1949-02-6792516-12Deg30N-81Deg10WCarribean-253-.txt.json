    "main event": "A United Fruit vessel reported three unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of the San Andres Islands in the Caribbean Sea on 6 February 1949, which were observed changing colors and displaying spherical appearances at varying altitudes and directions.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The first object, initially appearing as a disc, changed color from silver to yellow to red as it passed overhead the ship before disappearing in the dusk.",
        "The second and third objects were observed at different altitudes off the port and starboard bow of the ship, and none showed any luminosity or motivating power.",
        "The report suggests that the objects may have been some type of weather balloons, but it was deemed improbable that these balloons were released from nearby locations due to prevailing winds.",
        "The sighting occurred in the context of two Russian 300-ton sloops arriving in the vicinity, raising the possibility of the objects being in free flight after release from these ships.",
        "The changing colors of the objects were attributed to the reflection of the setting sun."
