        "The witness had not seen a similar object before, and the description is consistent with an astronomical observation.",
        "The witness was interviewed, and the interviewing officer discredited her report, stating that if she had not been drinking, she would not have called in the report.",
        "The interviewing officer noted that the witness appeared to be very irrational and wondered onto other unrelated subjects during the interview.",
        "The local airfield (Mathis Field) reported many local flights in the area at the time of the sighting."
