    "main event": "A slow-moving object was tracked on radar at Yuma, Arizona on February 27, 1961.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object's presentation on radar was similar to that of a single aircraft, but it began to break up and become diffused at around 42,223 feet.",
        "Despite moving at only 29 knots, the object left a trail of diffuse echoes extending behind it, similar to a stream of chaff.",
        "The rate of descent of the object was approximately 323 feet per minute until contact was lost.",
        "The officer who prepared the report had not encountered a similar radar presentation, except for chaff dropped from balloons in Alaska.",
        "The report concludes that the data is inadequate for evaluation, and the object remains unidentified."
