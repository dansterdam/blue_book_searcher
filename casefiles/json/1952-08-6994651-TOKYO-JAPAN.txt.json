  "main event": "On August 5, 1952, in Tokyo, Japan, a baseball-shaped unidentified flying object was observed by a Japanese National with 15 years of civil engineering experience. The object had a light trail similar to that of a large shooting star and changed colors from light orange and yellow to white with a bluish tinge before separating into two objects.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object's size was estimated to be as large as, or slightly larger than, a baseball and appeared to be approximately 2 to 3 times larger than a shooting star.",
    "At the last moment of observation, the object separated into two small objects, all following the same direction as the original object.",
    "The weather was fair with some clouds and moderate winds from the southwest, and the moon was shining brightly and shaped like a new crescent sketch at the time of the sighting.",
    "The object was seen by several persons from various USAF organizations, and observers concluded that the object was definitely a natural phenomenon.",
    "There was no sound associated with the object, and it was observed to fly almost in a straight line with a slight change in direction."
