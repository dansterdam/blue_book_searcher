    "main event": "A flying object was sighted in Puyallup, Washington on 27 July 1949 by military personnel. The object appeared as a long streak of light traveling parallel to the horizon for a few seconds, then appeared to explode or accelerate before narrowing out again.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was sighted by military personnel and possibly passengers from a low-flying airliner.",
        "The sighting occurred at dawn with clear weather conditions and poor visibility, making it impossible to determine the shape of the object.",
        "The streak of light appeared to be at the same altitude as the airliner, estimated to be about twenty miles away.",
        "The object's appearance was described as somewhat like a pip leveling out on a radar scope.",
        "No photographs or physical evidence of the object were obtained."
