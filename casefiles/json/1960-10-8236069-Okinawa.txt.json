    "main event": "Two unidentified Marine officers observed a bright, pulsating, oscillating object in the sky over Okinawa on October 29, 1960.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be round or oval in shape, red in color, and moved towards the observers before receding.",
        "The object remained visible for 5-7 minutes, oscillating up and down and side to side.",
        "The observers, a Major and a Captain, were experienced in observing the flight paths of satellites and did not believe the object was a balloon or aircraft.",
        "Weather conditions at the time included clear skies, unlimited visibility, and winds from the WNW at 12 knots gusting to 20 knots.",
        "The object's speed was estimated to be in the supersonic range, but the observers could not definitively determine the speed due to the lack of horizon reference."
