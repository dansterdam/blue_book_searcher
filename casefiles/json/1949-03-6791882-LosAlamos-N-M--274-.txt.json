  "main event": "On March 2nd, 1949 at 0010 hours, an inspector at AEC Los Alamos observed a light low in the sky traveling rapidly in a horizontal plane from north to south. The object appeared to be self-luminous, covered half of the observer's line of vision in two seconds, and disappeared behind trees.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting lasted only two seconds, but the object covered a significant portion of the observer's field of view in that time, indicating very fast speed.",
    "The object exhibited self-luminosity and appeared quite dim and constant in intensity, consistent throughout the brief sighting.",
    "The observer was a guard with the Atomic Energy Security Services, enhancing the credibility of the report.",
    "The weather conditions at the time of sighting included a thin overcast at 20,000 feet, providing context for the atmospheric conditions.",
    "The observation took place at AEC Los Alamos, adding a level of authority to the report due to the nature of the observer's employment."
