{
  "main event": "A credible witness reported observing chains of luminous discs moving in swift evolutions in the sky at Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, before dawn on a stormy day in Fall 1949.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The discs in the chains appeared to be about the size of the head of a safety match, with the chains about the length of a match-stick, and were described as having faint shades of blue, lavender, pink, and green.",
    "The witness initially thought the display could be related to the arrival of a squadron of jet planes, but the swift, intricate, and concentrated movement led them to doubt that explanation.",
    "The chains did not have the appearance of strung beads, but gave the impression that the discs overlapped slightly, like fish scales, as if the discs were set obliquely to the axis.",
    "The witness compared the display to the background pattern of Disney's 'Fantasia' and Fourth of July fireworks, with the trajectory of the chains resembling bursts from 'Flower-pots' and the chains themselves reminding them of star-chains from exploded rockets.",
    "Despite expecting others to have seen the occurrence, there were no reports from others, and the witness and their wife chose to say nothing about it until the subject of discs was renewed in the media."
