        "Checks were made with various departments, but no official investigation was required as per Air Force Regulations and no evidence of a celestial phenomenon or planet that could account for the sighting was found.",
        "The object appeared to have good control, and the manner of its disappearance was such that the observers were uncertain whether it was still visible.",
        "The sighting was reported based on a directive to report all sightings of unidentified flying objects, and a detailed description of the witnesses' reliability, sobriety, and hobbies was included."
