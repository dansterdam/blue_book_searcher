  "main event": "A sighting of an unusual aerial object was reported in Blackburn, Melbourne on 3rd January 1954 at 1330 hours. The sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds and involved a highly reflective silver object in the vicinity of the sun, which then moved erratically over the horizon before disappearing. The report was made by a military source and suggested the object was probably a balloon or aircraft, but there was uncertainty due to the briefness of the sighting.",

    "The sighting was made by a military source and reported to the Air Operations Room R.A.A.F.",
    "The witness, a housewife, appeared quite nervous and had no previous interest in 'flying saucers' or other aerial phenomena.",
    "The observer initially thought the object was a possible aircraft due to a noise but then described it as a definite object with no trail and possibly oval.",
    "The sighting lasted only 45 seconds and was described as highly reflective and silver in color, with no trail or exhaust visible.",
    "The report suggested that the sighting was probably a reflection from the sun of an aircraft or balloon, but there was uncertainty due to the briefness of the sighting."
