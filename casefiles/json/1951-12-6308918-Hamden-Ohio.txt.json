  "main event": "On December 22, 1951, in Hamden, Ohio, a bright light was reported in the sky, described as possibly astronomical, and it disappeared with the coming of daylight.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The report was phoned in to Lookbourne flight service and the tower at Lookbourne also reported seeing the bright light.",
    "The light was described as circular in shape, 75 to 100 feet in diameter, white or silvery in color, and appeared to be traveling vertically. It was too bright to be mistaken for a star and had fire around the edges.",
    "The sighting lasted for approximately 1 hour, and it was ultimately determined to be 'Constellation Star', suggesting a possible misidentification of astronomical phenomena.",
    "The witness described the light doubling in size and brilliancy, giving the illusion of motion. It changed from yellowish to bluish in color as the dawn approached, gradually waning and looking more like a star.",
    "The witness expressed surprise at the lack of bulletins from the Air Force to their control tower operators about the phenomenon."
