    "The observation was made by Lieutenant Shultz of the station, adding credibility to the report.",
    "No exhaust or propulsion was noted, indicating unconventional characteristics of the observed object.",
    "There were SAC bombers in actual operation in the area, leading to initial confusion and assessment of the UFO as a normal aircraft before its unconventional behavior became apparent.",
