  "main event": "On September 27, 1959, an observer reported a sighting of three lights - red, green, and white - which seemed to remain in one place. The shape of the object could not be determined, but it appeared angular. The duration of the observation was approximately half an hour.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observer initially reported the lights, but a Cincinnati astronomer identified them as a planet due to a prismatic effect caused by dust particles in the atmosphere.",
    "The observer described the object as round, somewhat elliptical, extremely bright, almost fluorescent, and emitting no sound.",
    "The observer estimated the distance of the object to be between 4500 to 8000 yards, and it passed nearly overhead at a distance of less than 1000 yards from the observer.",
    "The object seemed to continue on a straight course without noticeable altitude gain and disappeared without any detectable structural features.",
    "The report prompted the U.S. Air Force to request the observer to fill out a detailed questionnaire regarding the sighting."
