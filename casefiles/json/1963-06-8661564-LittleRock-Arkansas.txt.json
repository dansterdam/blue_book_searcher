    "main event": "A saucer-shaped object with a red dome that changed to white and back was observed over Little Rock, Arkansas on June 13, 1963.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed to disappear and reappear at intervals before eventually disappearing to the west.",
        "There were numerous takeoffs and landings from Little Rock Air Force Base and refueling operations involving KC-97 and B-47 aircraft in the area during the time of the sighting.",
        "The red glow of the object was likely caused by the tanker warning and position lights on the underside of the refueling aircraft, and the white glare was likely from the flashing of the landing or wing lights on the B-47 during the refueling operation.",
        "The civilian observer who reported the sighting seemed sincere but inexperienced in aircraft, leading to a tentative appraisal that the sighting was most likely of the refueling aircraft.",
        "No photographs were included with the report."
