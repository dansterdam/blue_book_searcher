					"main event": "On 2 April 1953, at Sondrestrom A.B., Greenland, two observers flying MATS aircraft reported sighting an unidentified light traveling in a northerly direction at an estimated speed of 165 knots. The object was observed for approximately three seconds.",
					"interesting points": [
						"The object was observed to be in a shallow descending turn and was estimated to be at an altitude of 30,000 feet.",
						"The observers compared this sighting to a similar one in Reykjavik, Iceland, and it was concluded that the phenomenon was probably astronomical in nature, possibly a meteor.",
						"On 6 April 1953, the crew of a B-36 aircraft observed unidentified flying objects over Sondrestrom, AB, Greenland. The objects were estimated to be approximately 20 to 30 feet in diameter and appeared to be metallic in nature.",
						"The objects were observed to make an abrupt change in direction, then accelerate at a high rate of speed and disappear from view.",
						"In a letter from the Ohio State University's Emerson McMillin Observatory, it is mentioned that the 8 April Greenland case was an obvious meteor, and various other sightings are discussed and analyzed."
