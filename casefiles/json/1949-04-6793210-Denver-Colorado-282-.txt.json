"main event": "Two civilian observers reported an elliptical-shaped flying object in Denver, Colorado on 6 April 1949, but subsequent investigations identified the object as a U.S. weather balloon.",
"interesting points": [
    "The observation occurred at 1500 hours local time and was seen by multiple witnesses, including an FBI agent and several civilians.",
    "Observers reported the object to be traveling rapidly and erratically, seemingly faster than a meteor and at a high altitude of 15,000-25,000 feet.",
    "Weather conditions at the time were reported to be clear with unlimited visibility, and upper air observations by the U.S. Weather Bureau station at Stapleton Field confirmed the launch of a weather balloon identical to the observed object.",
    "Radar observations at the time indicated no unusual ground echoes, and local flight schedules of commercial, private, and military aircraft in the vicinity yielded no pertinent information.",
    "Investigation reports and interviews with witnesses confirmed that the unidentified object was positively identified as a U.S. weather balloon, leading to the case being officially closed."
