  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed to have a tail and seemed to oscillate and drift, leading to the need for interception.",
    "Two fighters were scrambled for interception, and the objects were identified as unusual double balloons.",
    "The description of the objects indicates a cylindrical shape, white color, and an unusual climb between 31,000 to 32,000 feet, with a width of 5 to 6 feet.",
    "The observation lasted for about one hour, and the interception took place in a specific division.",
    "The visual appearance of the objects was initially unclear, leading to the need for visual identification and interception."
