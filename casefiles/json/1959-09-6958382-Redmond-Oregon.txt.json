  "interesting points": [
    "The radar return on the ground control scope was ultimately attributed to a transient from a gap filler antenna located on a mountain at the 8,100-foot level, rather than being an unidentified flying object.",
    "Multiple aircraft, including F-102 and F-89 types, were scrambled under the control of radar sites for the search and intercept operation, but they all returned with negative visual and radar results.",
    "A civilian T-33 type aircraft and an H-19 helicopter conducted a low altitude search, and a B-47 Strategic Air Command aircraft from Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, was also in the area during the operation.",
    "The Air Force informed the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) of all the facts and findings in connection with the sighting.",
    "Charges that the United States Air Force is withholding information from the general public on the subject of unidentified flying objects are described as completely unfounded in the letter."
