    "The reporter noticed a white, sharply defined bar in a hole in the clouds, followed by the appearance and disappearance of multiple bright objects in the sky.",
    "The second sighting involved a bright object observed beneath the moon, disappearing and leaving a faint vapor streak going up at about 40Â°.",
    "A neighbor also reported a similar UFO sighting a couple of months earlier, indicating limited location surveying and pendulous motion of the objects.",
    "No deviation from a perfectly horizontal position was observed in any of the objects, and the luminosity was greater than that of the thin, sunlit clouds.",
    "A picture of clouds taken earlier that afternoon, with one of the objects circled in pencil, was included as evidence."
