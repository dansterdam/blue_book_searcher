    "main event": "A small balloon, half plastic & half fibre, was sighted in Indiana by 3 hunters. It eventually got entangled in the power lines above the field.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The device was found to be a weather balloon for remote measurements of the strength of the earth's horizontal magnetic field.",
        "The device is a magnetometer for remote measurement of the strength of the earth's magnetic field, with the sensing element being supported by a pendulus mounting to measure the horizontal component.",
        "The device was likely carried to a high altitude by a balloon and then transmitted field strength measurements by telemetry to a ground station.",
        "The document is signed by G. T. Gregory, Capt. USAF, ATIC-24, and was returned to the 5th District OSI on 5 Feb 58 with an evaluation.",
        "The handwritten text on the third page also describes the device as a magnetometer for measuring the earth's magnetic field, and that it was likely carried by a balloon."
