        "The object was tracked by radar, which indicated it was moving slowly at first on a heading of 030 degrees, then turned to 100 degrees before contact was lost.",
        "Attempts to intercept the object with an aircraft were unsuccessful, and no known aircraft or balloons were present in the area at the time.",
        "The weather conditions were overcast with some haze and ground fog, but the observers consistently described the object as very bright, which could not be easily accounted for by a temperature inversion or cloud formations."
