  "main event": "On September 30, 1953, a spheroid-shaped silver object, approximately 6 to 8 feet in diameter, was sighted by Mr. [REDACTED] in Silver Springs, Maryland. It appeared to glide at about 300 feet over a house and then land in an adjacent golf course, the Indian Spring Country Club. The object did not emit light but was described as very bright.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed for approximately 1 second as it glided in a southwesterly direction, appearing parallel to Colesville Road.",
    "Weather conditions at the time were very good, with clear visibility and no cloud cover or thunderstorms in the area.",
    "Another witness, Mr. W. Cooper, saw a plane fly by 20 minutes after [REDACTED] sighted the object and stated that it was not a plane or flying disc.",
    "Investigations suggested that a meteor was seen in the area at approximately the same time as the sighting, providing a possible explanation for the observed object.",
    "The questionnaire was completed by the observer on February 6, 1957, and included details about the sighting and additional information as requested."
