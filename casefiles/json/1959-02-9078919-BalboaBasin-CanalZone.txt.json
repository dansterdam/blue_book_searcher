    "main event": "On 4th February 1959, a quite large, cone-shaped object, with a brilliant combination of three colors - white, yellow, and blue, was observed for 12 seconds in the Balboa Basin Canal Zone, Panama. The object had no tail, no exhaust, and made no sound. The conclusion drawn was that the object was probably a meteor.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The observed object was described as quite large, cone-shaped, and brilliant, with a combination of three colors - white, yellow, and blue, all well blended, giving it an iridescent and fluorescent appearance.",
        "The object had no tail, no exhaust, and made no sound.",
        "It was observed at an elevation of approximately 1000 feet and an azimuth of approximately 25 degrees, with a blue tail hue similar to aircraft exhaust color but more fan-shaped than pointed.",
        "The object approached from the east, traveled almost level flight to the west, and while passing a decline was slightly noticeable. It then altered its course slightly to the right instantaneously to the west.",
        "The observation was made by a civilian - a Panama Canal pilot - who was described as a 'very good' witness."
