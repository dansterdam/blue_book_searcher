        "The object was observed by ground-based radar on August 25, 1960 and was described as being as mobile as a conventional aircraft, disappearing behind trees.",
        "The observers did not report the sighting until September 13, 1960, so the report was considered to have insufficient data.",
        "On August 29, 1960, a visual sighting was reported of a bright, aluminum-colored object that descended behind trees after being observed for about 90-100 seconds.",
        "NASA forwarded the August 29, 1960 sighting report to the Air Force for further investigation.",
