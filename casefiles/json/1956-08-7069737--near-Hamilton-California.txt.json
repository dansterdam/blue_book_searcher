    "main event": "A radar observer in an F-89D aircraft at 20,000 feet observed a clear silver round object near the contrail of a B-47 aircraft on August 21, 1956 near Hamilton, California.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was initially observed near the contrail of the B-47 aircraft, about 2 miles to the rear of the aircraft.",
        "The object appeared to go between the interceptor aircraft (F-89D) and the contrail, and under the contrail, leading the pilot to believe the object was close and initiate a maximum performance intercept.",
        "The object appeared to pull away and the pilot had to return to base due to low fuel.",
        "The object was estimated to be a possible balloon, but the weather report stated no balloons were released in the area at the approximate time of the sighting.",
        "The pilot believes the object remained at the same altitude and the radar observer believes it was glowing."
