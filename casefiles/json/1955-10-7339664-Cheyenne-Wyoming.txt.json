    "main event": "A blue lighted disc-shaped object was observed in Cheyenne, Wyoming on October 16, 1955.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object made a few loops and had a sound like an electric motor.",
        "The report concluded that the sighting was likely a locomotive sound generating lighting effects, and the details were attributed to an overactive imagination.",
        "Multiple witnesses reported seeing unusual sights or sounds, but investigators were unable to corroborate these claims.",
        "One witness, a diesel-electric locomotive operator, was located south of the sighting area at the time, which may account for the observed movement and sound.",
        "The reliability of the witnesses was questioned, and it was concluded that no actual object was sighted, but rather the witnesses saw and heard a passing locomotive."
