    "main event": "On May 9, 1949, at approximately 2:30 PM in Tuscon, Arizona, a military observer witnessed two round, silvery, flat objects flying at a very high rate of speed from the southwest to the northeast, maintaining a level flight and in formation. The objects were approximately 25 feet in diameter and 1 foot thick, traveling at a speed between 750 and 1000 miles per hour. No apparent means of propulsion, vapor trail, or sound were observed. They eventually faded from view and disappeared after 6-10 seconds.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The observer, a W/Sgt. in the USAF, witnessed the objects from the front lawn of his residence and was a trained flight engineer with extensive experience with conventional aircraft and jet fighter aircraft.",
        "The objects were reported to be considerably faster than any aircraft the observer had ever seen.",
        "No physical evidence or witnesses besides the observer were found, and the weather and flight schedules for that day did not provide a plausible explanation.",
        "The observer was deemed of normal intelligence and good character, with a fairly rounded education and an ability to determine color, speed, and size of moving objects at a distance.",
        "The observer reported the sighting to the Squadron Security Officer the following day, and expressed disbelief in conventional explanations for the observed objects' behavior."
