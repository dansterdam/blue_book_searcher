    "main event": "Two military officers were interrogated after sighting an unconventional aircraft in Sacramento, California, on 31 August 1949. They observed a dark, fast, and noiseless object with a dull grey or silver finish flying at an estimated speed of 700 to 800 miles per hour at an altitude of about 15,000 feet.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The witnesses were both experienced and familiar with unusual celestial phenomena, yet they were certain that the object they observed was not a celestial phenomenon.",
        "The object appeared to be exceptionally large and had a dull reflection with a streamlined shape, resembling a boomerang or crescent, and made no sound during its flight.",
        "It had short, stubby wings, a short, rounded nose, and no visible tail surfaces, jet exhaust, or navigational lights.",
        "Both witnesses independently estimated the object's speed, direction of flight, and dimensions, and their reports were consistent despite agreeing not to describe the object to each other in order not to influence each other's opinion.",
        "The Office of Special Investigations continued the investigation as other similar sightings were reported in the area."
