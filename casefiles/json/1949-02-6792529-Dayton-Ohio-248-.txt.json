	"main event": "An unidentified aerial object was observed north of Dayton, Ohio on 10th Feb 49, traveling at high speed before disintegrating into two pieces. The sighting lasted approximately 5 seconds and was observed by a reliable USAF pilot.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The object was described as larger than a star, with a round shape and a blue glow on the bottom fading to orange before disintegration.",
		"It appeared at an altitude slightly above 7,900 feet and was initially spotted descending slowly at a 10-degree angle.",
		"The object had a trail five times the length of the object tapering to a point and was highly luminous, described as incandescent and very brilliant like a white flare.",
		"Despite the object's steady speed and slight descent, its manner of disappearance involved breaking into two parts and disintegrating, with the front piece disappearing immediately and the back piece breaking into clusters and shooting ahead before fading.",
		"The sighting occurred under specific weather conditions with very bright moonlight above an overcast and broken overcast clouds in the northwest."
