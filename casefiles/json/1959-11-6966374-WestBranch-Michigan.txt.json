    "main event": "A radar detected eight visually-spaced objects in the sky for 3 seconds, which were then tracked on ground radar for 5 minutes. The objects were observed to merge and break up, with radar tracks fluctuating and the objects moving at great speed.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects appeared red and at first seemed to be reflections in red tower lights, but when they reappeared, they were assumed to be elliptical in shape, about 30 feet long.",
        "There was insufficient data to fully analyze the sighting, and it was concluded that it could have been a reflection of something.",
        "The case was listed as having insufficient data for evaluation."
