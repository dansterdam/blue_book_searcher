    "main event": "Civilian witness observed a single stationary object in the night sky over Columbus, Ohio for approximately 4 hours from August 17-20, 1965.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be about the size of a star and was observed moving in a southward direction, contrary to the motion of stars and planets.",
        "The object's brightness varied, shifting between bright and dim, and also displayed changing colors.",
        "The witness reported the object to the Air Force but did not make any effort to get a closer look, as the object was estimated to be about 150 feet away.",
        "The Air Force concluded that the observation was inaccurate or illusory, likely due to the object's characteristics and motion not matching that of known celestial bodies.",
        "The sighting occurred during the early morning hours, from midnight to 4 AM, on clear nights only."
