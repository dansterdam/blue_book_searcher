    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as round in shape with light rays emitting from it, and its size was compared to being less than a dime held at arm's length.",
        "The object had a yellowish glow that twinkled like a star and did not make any sound or have a visible trail or exhaust.",
        "The object was first observed in the east at an elevation of around 45 degrees, but when the observers rechecked it around 30 minutes later, the object was no longer visible.",
        "A check of the astronomical almanac showed that the planet Saturn was in the same general area of the sky as the reported object at the time of the sighting.",
        "The preparing officer concluded that the object was most likely the planet Saturn, as it matched the description and the fact that it disappeared as Saturn moved into its normal position in the night sky."
