    "interesting points": [
        "The light appeared to be about one degree above the horizon in the direction of the Modesto Airport, and the witnesses initially believed it to be an aircraft with landing lights on.",
        "The news photographer set up his camera on the newspaper building's roof but noticed the elliptical light in the photograph, which was unexplained, and contacted Castle Air Force Base for further inquiry.",
        "The exposure settings used for the photograph were specified as f22 with unattended exposure for opening and closing the shutter, and it was developed on the same day.",
        "A different report indicated an investigation of an unidentified elliptical shape sighted over Modesto, and there was a description of a light with a distinct reddish-orange color that appeared brighter than a star and had a pulsing effect.",
        "Another observation by civil defense ground observers suggested the presence of a small aircraft with landing light on, flying the traffic pattern at Modesto Airport, based on their statements and the location of the runway relative to the observers."
