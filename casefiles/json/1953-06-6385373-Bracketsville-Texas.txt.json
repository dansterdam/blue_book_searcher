    "main event": "Military personnel stationed near Brackettville, Texas observed small, high-speed objects maneuvering in the sky over the area during the period of March 21-27, 1952.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were described as sharply defined against the sky, capable of extreme speed and rapid changes in direction, and frequently disappearing from view and reappearing in another location.",
        "On March 23, an object was seen at approximately 1920 hours which appeared to be trailing sparks or fire particles. The object approached the observers at high speed, stopped abruptly, hovered momentarily, and then accelerated away at tremendous speed.",
        "The observers, all of whom are thoroughly reliable and experienced in observing aircraft, are convinced that the objects seen could not have been conventional aircraft.",
        "The extraordinary performance characteristics exhibited, especially the ability to suddenly stop and accelerate at such tremendous speeds, would appear to rule out the possibility of the objects being either aircraft or meteorological phenomena.",
        "The report was classified and subject to declassification after 12 years."
