    "main event": "Between 15-20 August 1947, an Air Force officer in Weaver, South Dakota observed twelve elliptical, brilliant yellowish-white objects ascending to 25,000 feet in about two minutes, displaying highly maneuverable behavior and remaining equally spaced in all maneuvers.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were observed in a tight diamond formation at 4000 to 10,000 ft, ascending rapidly to 25,000 feet in about two minutes.",
        "Each object was estimated to be 100 feet in length, oval-shaped, and emitted no sound or exhaust trail.",
        "The observer's reliability was questioned due to the difficulty of estimating distance and size without prior knowledge, as well as the detailed recall of the observation made a year later.",
        "The presence of detached auroral streamers was suggested as a possible explanation.",
        "The report contains evaluations of incidents with varying probabilities, including astronomical, non-astronomical, and unexplained causes."
