    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared at 35 degrees elevation, was first observed at a distance of 2 to 300 yards, and disappeared at a distance of 5-6 miles.",
        "The object was estimated to be 1,000 feet in altitude and 45-50 feet in diameter, and was observed to be moving at a speed of approximately 1,200 mph.",
        "The object did not have any sound or trail, and the observation of its attitude and distance did not suggest it was a meteor.",
        "A thorough investigation was conducted to eliminate the possibility of the object being a weather balloon, test aircraft, helicopter, or other known phenomenon, but all results were negative.",
        "The only possibility that could not be completely eliminated was that the object was a meteorite, but the description of the object and the observer's estimates made this analysis unlikely."
