  "main event": "On May 29, 1949 in Elko, Nevada, a railroad yard clerk observed five amber-colored lights in a V formation, traveling at over 500 miles per hour at an altitude of 10,000 feet, with no discernible sound or visible signs of exhaust.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observer noted that the lights appeared steady, giving the appearance of being seen through a window, rather than that of a ray or beam.",
    "There were no other witnesses to the sighting, and no physical evidence was reported.",
    "Review of aircraft and weather information at the time did not provide an explanation for the observed lights.",
    "The witness's uncertainty about whether the lights came from one very large aircraft or five smaller ones flying in formation adds to the mystery of the sighting.",
    "The case was referred to the Air Materiel Command and was classified as a ground-visual observation."
