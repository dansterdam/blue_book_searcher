  "main event": "On 23 July 1954, three metallic, circular, white-colored objects in line were observed in South Lakewood, New Jersey, at an altitude. The objects exhibited mechanical lighting speeds and one portion of the circles emitted a brilliant white light for about 5 seconds. The observation lasted for 30 minutes, but there was insufficient data for evaluation and the manner of disappearance was not included.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The UFO report was a ground-radar observation by a civilian at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, N.J.",
    "The observation described the objects as moving at great speeds and emitting a brilliant white light for a short duration.",
    "The report mentions a delay in reporting from the time of the sighting, prompting submission of the report by letter rather than message.",
    "Despite the observation lasting 30 minutes, there was insufficient data for evaluation, and the reason for the delay in reporting was not mentioned.",
    "The document included a hand-drawn diagram depicting the unidentified aerial phenomenon, showing a bright arc-shaped light with additional textual descriptions of its observed characteristics."
