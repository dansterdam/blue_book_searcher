    "main event": "On December 1, 1957, at around 1630 local time, a brightly burning object was observed falling in the vicinity of Hamburg, Germany. The object struck the earth at an angle of about 30 degrees above the horizontal, leaving a singed area with a white-gray-oxide residue.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was determined to be non-meteoritic, and no metallic pieces were recovered, only products of combustion.",
        "Analysis of residue revealed magnesium and aluminum oxides, with the former predominant in quantity.",
        "Extensive digging operations were conducted at the site by German Army Engineers, but no metal was discovered, leading to the conclusion that the object was not of terrestrial origin.",
        "The theory that the object was a ship's signal device was suggested, but the closest ship to the point of impact was one and a half miles away, making this theory unlikely.",
        "The incident was investigated by a responsible person and considered closed by local authorities after the hole created by the impact was refilled."
