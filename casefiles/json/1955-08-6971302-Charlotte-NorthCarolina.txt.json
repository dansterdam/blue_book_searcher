    "main event": "On August 3, 1955, in Charlotte, North Carolina, a civilian reported a sighting of a very bright object, brighter than normal stars, that appeared to be split in the middle and revolved around each other. The object was yellow and white and traveled from directly overhead to the eastern horizon in two to three seconds.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as a very bright light, similar in size to a half dollar held at arm's length, and had yellow and white colors.",
        "The sighting lasted only two to three seconds, indicating the speed at which the object traveled across the sky.",
        "The report indicates that the delay in receiving information led to the investigation not starting until 1 1/2 months after the sighting.",
        "Possible conclusions included it being a blimp, balloon, aircraft, or astronomical object due to insufficient data for evaluation.",
        "The report also mentioned that the object's rapid movement across the sky raised the possibility of it being astronomical in nature."
