        "The objects performed 'fantastic acrobatics' over the city before one of them dove low over the woman's house and dropped the liquid substance.",
        "Analysis of the metallic fragments showed the material to be pure tin, unlike any known metal on Earth.",
        "The Brazilian Air Force investigated the incident and collected fragments, but their analysis showed the material was merely silica.",
        "There were large airports nearby, leading to speculation that the material could have come from a passing plane.",
        "The reporter who originally investigated the incident later claimed the Air Force had deliberately covered up the unimpeachable data he had gathered."
