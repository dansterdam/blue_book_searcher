  "main event": "On January 25, 1951, multiple observers in Warner Robins, Georgia, reported a sighting of an unidentified flying object described as a cone-shaped with a steady red glow, moving at incredibly high speeds, estimated at 3600 m.p.h. It hovered at high altitudes and exhibited unusual movement patterns before disappearing from view.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was estimated to be about 3/4 the size of the full moon when seen at 150 feet away, indicating its substantial size.",
    "The observer, identified as a pilot with 20/20 vision and experience in aircraft operation, reported unusual and erratic movement of the object.",
    "Despite the bright sunlight and clear skies, the object remained visible and attracted the attention of multiple witnesses, including a civilian and an aircraft mechanic.",
    "The object was initially mistaken for a plane on fire due to its bright and erratic movement, but it exhibited unconventional behavior such as hovering and abrupt stops before changing direction.",
    "No noise, vibration, or odor was associated with the object, and there was no evidence of smoke or fire, leading to the conclusion that it was not a conventional aircraft."
