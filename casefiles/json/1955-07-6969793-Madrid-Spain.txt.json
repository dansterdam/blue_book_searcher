    "The object appeared to be saucer-shaped, larger than standard aircraft, and illuminated by the setting sun, with a smaller reddish-orange object below it.",
    "It hovered over the Castellana Hilton Hotel at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet and was observed descending and rising without apparent motive power.",
    "The physicians described the object as metallic, reflected sunlight, and seemed to be under intelligent control.",
    "They reported unusual aerial phenomena, which they could not explain, and requested further investigation and contact with those capable of evaluating their reports properly.",
    "Another sighting on July 10, 1955, involved a strange aerial object about 15 to 20 feet in diameter, silently traveling across the night sky from west to east at phenomenal speed, leaving a bright whitish glow."
