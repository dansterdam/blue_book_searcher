    "main event": "Ground radar picked up a light traveling in a parabolic path, which was also observed visually as irregular colored objects moving rapidly.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The radar return was likely caused by atmospheric conditions and did not indicate a real object.",
        "The visual sighting consisted of irregular colored objects similar to metallic stars with pulsating lights, which moved rapidly according to both radar and visual observations.",
        "The case was concluded as probably an aircraft, with insufficient data to identify the object conclusively.",
        "There were multiple witness types, including ground radar, ground visual, and air visual observations.",
        "The objects were described as moving rapidly, changing brightness, and making starts and stops."
