        "The object was described as 25-30 feet in diameter and was observed for approximately 25 minutes by several military units.",
        "The object was said to be oscillating and spinning in motion, but the distance was too great to make a more detailed observation.",
        "The report concluded that the object was probably a balloon, but there was insufficient data to make a definitive evaluation.",
        "The weather conditions at the time of the sighting were partly cloudy with winds aloft, but no unusual activity was reported in the area.",
