    "main event": "A radar detection of one or two unidentified flying objects on the East Coast of the United States on July 29, 1965.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The radar observation was not directly observed, only detected by ground radar.",
        "The report indicates that the observed objects were able to change directions radically at high speeds, which suggests they were not natural objects.",
        "The report states that additional information would be needed to properly analyze the radar data, including the types of radars involved, their operating frequencies, weather conditions, and the direction of target travel.",
        "The report suggests the radar detection may have been due to anomalous propagation of the radar waves, which can make it difficult to substantiate the observations.",
        "The report was forwarded for further evaluation by the Foreign Technology Division of the Air Force Systems Command."
