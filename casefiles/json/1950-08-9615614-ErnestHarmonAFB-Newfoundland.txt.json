    "interesting points": [
        "The object was tracked on radar, estimated to be traveling at 40-60 mph at an altitude of 4-6 thousand feet on a course of 120 degrees.",
        "The radar contact became brighter and more distinct as it approached, comparable to a small aircraft, but no aircraft were in the area at the time.",
        "Three separate civilian witnesses on the ground visually observed an object that was round, black or dark in color, about the size of a basketball, partially enclosed in a hazy or cloudy halo.",
        "The object was observed to hover, ascend and descend several times over the course of 15 minutes before disappearing from view.",
        "Local weather conditions and the possibility of a weather balloon were considered, but the witnesses were deemed reliable and the object's behavior was described as unusual."
