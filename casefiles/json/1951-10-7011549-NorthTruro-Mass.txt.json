	"main event": "On 22 October 1951, radar operators at North Truro, Massachusetts observed an unidentified object on their radar scopes, with a characteristic 'sausage shape' and a smaller dimension in range than in azimuth. The object was observed for two minutes, traveling west and then south at an estimated speed of 2400 knots.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The radar returns and appearance of the track of the object substantiated the probability of it being a flying object rather than radar interference or malfunction.",
		"The object's track faded at a distance of 30 miles north of the station, with it being unknown whether it did so because it plunged into the water or due to flying at an extremely high altitude.",
		"The weather conditions at the time of sighting included scattered clouds and 15 miles visibility with a temperature of 42Â°F.",
		"The possibility of meteors entering the atmosphere and being detected was considered, with the report noting that the short duration of the condition supported this theory rather than anomalous propagation.",
		"The 2-minute observation of the object, its speed, and the radar returns led to the conclusion that it was most likely a flying object rather than a conventional aircraft, but the specific nature of the object remained unknown."
