{
	"main event": "An ex-Air Force pilot and others observed an object with a vapor trail traveling at a speed of 1700-1800 mph in Las Vegas, Nevada on either 8 or 9 October 1947. The object made an approximately 150Â° turn of radius five to fifteen miles before proceeding away in the direction of its first appearance.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The sighting was reported by an ex-Air Force pilot and others, adding credibility to the observation.",
		"The object's trail dissipated in fifteen to twenty minutes",
		"The weather was described as 'almost cloudless' at the time of the sighting.",
		"The report mentions the difficulty in understanding why the pilot attached importance to the observation, suggesting skepticism from the AIC (Air Intelligence Center).",
		"The observation was initially considered to potentially be that of a fireball, but the course flown made it almost fatal to such a hypothesis."
