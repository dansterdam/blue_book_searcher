  "main event": "Two objects, described as a circle of six lights with a seventh light trailing behind, were observed by a civilian at Surfside Pier, S.C. for 3-4 minutes at 20-minute intervals. The six lights were dull yellow, with a brilliant blue-green center light and a reddish light within the circle.",

  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were as big as a hula hoop held at arm's length, and a witness also described them as looking like a flying Christmas tree.",
    "The sighting occurred at night, with no sound accompanying the objects, and was observed through binoculars.",
    "The objects made four passes over the observers, all on approximately the same course, and the configuration changed during the fourth pass, causing a flash and exhibiting different light patterns.",
    "The observation took place on a clear but gusty night, and weather conditions were documented, ruling out thunderstorm activity in the area.",
    "The preparing officer believed that the objects were the two KB-50 tankers refueling the F-100 aircraft, however, the observer had never seen an aerial refueling before."
