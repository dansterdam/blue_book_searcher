    "main event": "A series of blinking lights in a V formation were observed in the sky near Hampton, Virginia on February 25, 1958. The lights remained steady for about 2 hours before going out.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The lights appeared to be very high up, around 20,000 feet or more.",
        "The lights moved in a straight line but would sometimes move down sideways, which seemed very strange to the witness.",
        "The witness initially thought the lights were a formation of aircraft, but the duration of the sighting and the fact that the lights remained in the same relative position made him think they were probably not aircraft.",
        "A second sighting of circular, bright objects that hovered and maneuvered in the sky was also reported in Hampton, Virginia on the same date.",
        "The objects were described as moving at very high speeds, estimated around 600-800 knots."
