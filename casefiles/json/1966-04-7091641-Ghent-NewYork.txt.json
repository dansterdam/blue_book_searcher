        "The object oscillated back and forth, with the beams emitting tiny, equally bright lights at the ends.",
        "The object moved very little to the north about 75 to 100 yards over the course of the 45-minute observation, from 11:30 PM to 12:15 AM.",
        "The brilliant lights from the object made the brightest stars appear dim in comparison.",
