  "main event": "On 7 July 1947 in Phoenix, Arizona, an observer witnessed an elliptical, flat, shiny object, measuring 20-30 ft across, flying 500-600 mph, spiraling downward to 2000 ft from 3000 ft, then ascending at a 45Â° angle into an overcast.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object appeared to be jet black with sharp outlines in the photographs, but experts disagreed on the possibility of such an appearance under the described conditions.",
    "The observer's character and business affiliations were under investigation, and Dr. Irving Langmuir discounted the photographed object as being merely paper swept up by the winds after learning of the prior passage of a thunderstorm.",
    "The observer refused to release parts of the data, stating that doing so would breach the confidentiality among one of his specialties.",
    "A negative of the photograph was carelessly stored and has faded noticeably. The observer was stimulated by an article in Amazing Stories magazine and H.G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds,\" and had shared details of the photographs during interviews with radio stations.",
    "The witness thought the photographs were of great value due to the publicity they brought, and the request for advice on how to proceed with the document suggests an interest in leveraging the photographs for personal gain.",
