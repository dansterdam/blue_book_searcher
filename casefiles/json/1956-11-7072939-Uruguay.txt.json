  "main event": "In November 1956 in Uruguay, a pilot reported a circular, solid, metallic object moving at a constant speed, south of Buenos Aires. The object was about 3 minutes long, and there were no photos of the sighting available. The report lacks specific details such as the length of observation, and it was considered insufficient for evaluation.",
