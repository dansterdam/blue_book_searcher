    "interesting points": [
        "An investigation team was sent to the scene but could not find any evidence to substantiate the original report, such as a hole in the ground or any physical object.",
        "The investigators interviewed witnesses but could not find anyone who actually saw the object fall to the ground, and the initial report of a 'thud' sound was inconclusive.",
        "An attempt was not made to locate the source of the alleged explosion, as that was not considered an Air Force responsibility.",
        "The investigators concluded that it was possible no such incident had occurred and the noise heard was likely just a normal building material landing.",
        "A separate incident was reported at Elmwood AFS, Ohio on June 7, 1960, where an unidentified flying object was observed, but the subsequent investigation revealed negative results."
