  "main event": "Multiple radar and visual observations were made of an unidentified flying object (UFO) over New York and Alabama in November 1957, with reported speeds of up to 1500 knots and unusual maneuverability.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The UFO was observed traveling at approximately 1500 knots and created a loud rumbling sound as it passed, after which it disappeared from view.",
    "Another observation in Alabama described a bright, oval-shaped object the size of a 'DC-6' at a distance of 35 miles, which remained stationary at first and then moved slowly east before disappearing.",
    "The inability of airborne radar to pick up the target in Alabama indicates it was not metallic, and the object was suspected to be a natural phenomenon or unusual meteorological condition.",
    "The radar picked up a target 15 miles long and 10 miles wide over Alabama, which suddenly disappeared from the radar screen, posing a challenge to explain based on conventional aircraft or astronomical phenomena.",
    "Observations mentioned the UFO's unusual performance characteristics, with speeds reported up to 17,000 MPH and erratic signaling behavior that defied conventional explanations."
