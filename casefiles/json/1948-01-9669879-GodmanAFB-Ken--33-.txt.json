However, communications were lost with the pilot and the aircraft subsequently crashed, resulting in the pilot's death.",
    "Multiple reports of a large bright light traveling across the sky were received from various locations, including St. Louis and Scott Towers, as well as an astronomer at Vanderbilt University, who identified the object as a pear-shaped balloon with cables and ballast attached, moving at a speed of 10 miles per hour at an altitude of 25,000 feet.",
