    "main event": "An unidentified aerial object was observed multiple times on May 3, 1949 in Los Alamos, New Mexico. The object appeared as a white light, similar in size to an aircraft landing light, and was sighted by AEC security inspectors and other observers.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was seen at different times between 2113 and 2205, each time appearing for 3-7 seconds and moving very fast.",
        "It was observed to have a very bright white light, with no sound or odor associated with it.",
        "On the second sighting, the object appeared to hover in one place for approximately 3 seconds before moving north.",
        "The sighting occurred during the Aquarid meteor shower, which reaches its maximum on May 4th. This context raises questions about a potential astronomical explanation for the observations.",
        "Multiple security inspectors from the AEC were involved as observers, adding credibility to the report."
