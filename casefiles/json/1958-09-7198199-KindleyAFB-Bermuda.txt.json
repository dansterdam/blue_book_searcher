    "main event": "Multiple objects were observed on ground radar at Kindley AFB in Bermuda in September 1952, traveling at high speeds and appearing extremely bright.",
    "interesting points": [
        "More than 20 objects were observed on the radar scope, with one object described as larger and at a higher altitude than the others.",
        "Radar contact could not be maintained continuously, and the evaluation indicated that some of the sightings were probably balloons.",
        "There were subsequent reports indicating a sighting of a small object departing Kindley AFB, but little information was available due to the short duration of the observation.",
        "The duration of sightings with similar objects at longer ranges was estimated to be 5 to 10 minutes, with the objects passing out of the area at a rate of approximately 5300 yards per minute.",
        "The reports and observations were inconclusive, and there was insufficient information to make a definitive evaluation."
