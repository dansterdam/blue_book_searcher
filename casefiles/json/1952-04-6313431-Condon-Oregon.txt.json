  "main event": "On April 22, 1952, in Condon, Oregon, three shiny metallic disc-shaped objects were observed moving fast in formation with a gray-brown underside. The objects were tracked visually and spatially for at least 2 minutes and 15 seconds before fading from view at an estimated altitude of 20,000 to 30,000 feet.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed to have a speed substantially greater than that of any known aircraft in the area, estimated at exceeding 1,700 mph.",
    "The visual observation was made by two credible observers, witnessed without any other evidence.",
    "The objects appeared to move erratically in their aerial pattern, indicating unusual behavior.",
    "The report was downgraded and declassified many years after the event, suggesting an ongoing interest in the sighting.",
    "The document was part of the Project Blue Book, which was a systematic study of unidentified flying objects conducted by the United States Air Force."
