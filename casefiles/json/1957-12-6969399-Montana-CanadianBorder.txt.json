    "main event": "On December 8, 1957, the pilot of an F-89 jet reported encountering a 'ball of light' which seemed to follow his aircraft, streaking on the inside of his turn and then suddenly disappearing to another heading. The encounter lasted for about 10 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be rotating and exhibited unusual behavior, such as streaking to the west at a steep angle of climb and dropping in flight before disappearing.",
        "Although the conclusion suggested a probable weather phenomenon intersecting with a shadow (black dart) thrown on the contrail, the object's behavior did not entirely fit this explanation.",
        "The pilot's UFO report was followed at almost the same level when he went into a turn, but the heavy haze made it difficult to maintain visual or radar contact with the object.",
        "The report involved credible witnesses, as it was made by the pilot of an F-89 jet.",
        "The report also indicated that the object did not fit the sight, shape, or performance of any known aircraft, according to intelligence officers."
