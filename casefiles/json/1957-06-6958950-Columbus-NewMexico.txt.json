  "main event": "On 13 June 1957 in Columbus, New Mexico, a bright and large stationary object was observed, seen to move to the southwest and then return to its original position for approximately 2 minutes. The observation was concluded as a probable balloon, possibly astronomical or aircraft, with insufficient data for evaluation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting lasted for 2 minutes and involved a single bright, large stationary object that moved to the southwest and returned to its original position.",
    "The conclusion indicated that it was likely a buildup of a probable balloon, possibly astronomical, or possibly an aircraft, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the observation.",
    "The object was estimated to be between 15,300 to 22,200 feet above the pilot's altitude of 45,000 feet, remaining stationary or possibly moving very slowly before slowly rising for approximately 15 minutes.",
    "The observation was made by a pilot scanning the horizon, with the object initially sighted above and high in the 12 o'clock position, remaining visible for around 15 minutes while the aircraft was in level flight.",
    "Weather conditions at the time of the sighting were reported as clear with a visibility of 60 miles and surface winds coming from the west."
