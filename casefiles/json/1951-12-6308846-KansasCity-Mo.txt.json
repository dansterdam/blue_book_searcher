    "main event": "A police officer in Kansas City observed a flying saucer moving in a northwest direction at an altitude slightly higher than a B-29 plane, giving off a metallic sheen and being rather transparent, for approximately one minute.",
    "interesting points": [
        "Corporal Gibson, a member of the police department, observed the flying saucer at precisely 2:12 o'clock in the afternoon.",
        "The weather bureau confirmed that there were no balloons in the area at that time, and the winds at the observed altitude were blowing from southwest to northeast, which would make it unlikely for a balloon to be traveling in the described direction.",
        "The flying saucer was described as perfectly round, with an inner core resembling the fuselage of a small airplane equipped with stubby wings.",
        "The witness, Corporal Gibson, mentioned that the flying saucer made no noise.",
        "The sighting was described in a newspaper article in the Kansas City Times on December 8, 1951."
