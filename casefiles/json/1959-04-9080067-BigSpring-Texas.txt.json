		"The objects were observed to be round with a greenish blue glow, egg shaped with one tail, white with blue edges, and round/flat slightly pointed at each end with white or cream in the middle and reddish orange around the edge.",
		"The witnesses observed the rapidly moving unidentified object without sound and watched it for 3 to 4 minutes.",
