    "main event": "Six unidentified objects with the appearance of an upside down light colored cone were sighted in Cashmere, Washington on September 30, 1957.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were dark on the inside with spots for markings, and appeared to be about the size of a quarter at a fairly low altitude.",
        "The objects appeared and disappeared erratically while in view, and were said to be traveling very fast.",
        "The investigating officer stated that the source claimed the objects appeared to be dropped (possibly as parachutists) from or attached to the objects.",
        "No logical explanation was offered for the sighted objects, despite inquiries with nearby weather services and bases about potential balloon launchings.",
        "The sighting was reported by a group of 4-12 adults and children, and the investigating state patrol officer initially laughed at the story before the witnesses became indignant at his disbelief."
