  "main event": "On 23 March 1953, a large single orange disk was observed moving very rapidly in a southerly direction over Natrona County Airport, Casper, Wyoming, and then disappeared behind Casper Mountain. The observation was visualized by three persons standing on the ground at the airport.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as a bright orange light with no sound, moving very fast and surveying the Air Base from the air in a zigzag manner.",
    "It appeared to act like it was suspended, swinging back and forth before disappearing in the distance.",
    "There was no evidence of weather phenomenon that could cause this reaction, and further investigation by qualified personnel was suggested.",
    "A follow-up report was made of an additional sighting from the same location later, which was exactly like the initial sighting but did not travel in the same direction nor in the same manner.",
    "The sighting was observed for approximately 3 minutes, during which the object was seen to rise rapidly on a zigzag course from the airstrip."
