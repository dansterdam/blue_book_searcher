  "main event": "An aircraft crew sighted an amber object in Labrador, Goose Bay - Frobisher Bay, on 11 November 1956, which overtook and passed their aircraft before disappearing. The object was initially thought to be a jet type aircraft but was later identified as a rocket from the USS Rushmore conducting rocket firing tests in the area.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting lasted for only 15-20 seconds, and the object was estimated to be about 10 miles away from the reporting aircraft.",
    "There were no other known air traffic or radar contacts in the area at the time of the sighting.",
    "The crew initially thought the object to be a jet type aircraft, indicating that it exhibited characteristics of high speed and maneuverability.",
    "The subsequent identification of the object as a rocket from USS Rushmore points to the possibility of misidentifications of aerial phenomena as advanced technology during that time.",
    "The report provides details such as the specific coordinates, altitude, heading, and speed of both the reporting aircraft and the estimated position of the unidentified object."
