  "main event": "Seven unknown objects were sighted in formation over Montevideo, Uruguay on December 7, 1958, by a civilian observer. The objects were flying at an estimated altitude of 2,000 meters and a speed of 1,500 kilometers per hour on a clear moonless night. The observer noted the irregular formation and the objects' behavior as if they were a single mass.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The saucers did not appear to rotate on their own axis, as the observer reported seeing two points under each one, indicating that they were not pivoting.",
    "The saucers were not self-illuminating and were visible due to the city lights reflecting on them.",
    "The irregular formation and behavior of the objects were similar to a famous film taken in Utah, USA, which showed saucers in irregular formation and abrupt movements.",
    "The observer, who was a qualified pilot, emphasized the need to pool all information on flying saucers and expressed disbelief in the perception that witnesses of such phenomena are considered crazy.",
    "It is noted that the observer had previously seen flying saucers and firmly believed in their existence."
