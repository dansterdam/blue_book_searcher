        "The object traveled much too rapidly for it to be a balloon, precluding a valid conclusion about its nature.",
        "The object was observed for 10 to 15 minutes, during which it disappeared and reappeared much dimmer before disappearing completely.",
        "The observers, including an experienced pilot, initially thought the object was stationary, perhaps a weather balloon, until its rapid movement.",
        "No other sightings of the object were reported in the area.",
        "The observers attempted to close in on the object, but it disappeared and then moved away rapidly and was lost to view."
