    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were detected at altitudes of around 25,000-28,000 feet and were moving slowly with discontinuous flight paths.",
        "The radar sites were unable to obtain the speed of the objects, but they traveled approximately 620 nautical miles in 43 minutes.",
        "Both radar sites detected the objects during the same time period, but it was determined they were not detecting the same objects.",
        "There were no known temperature inversions in the area at the time of the detections.",
        "No intercept action was taken, and there was no known air traffic in the area at the time."
