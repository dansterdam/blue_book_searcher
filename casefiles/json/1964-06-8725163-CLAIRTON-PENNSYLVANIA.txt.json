    "main event": "A bright luminous spherical object was observed hovering in Clairton, Pennsylvania on September 7, 1964. The object then shot away in a zig-zag motion and broke into eleven distinct pieces that formed a V-shaped pattern and sped away.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was estimated to be 40-50 feet in diameter and rotated in a counter-clockwise direction.",
        "On June 8, 1964, a witness reported seeing bright, round, white lights in a horizontal row that appeared to move rapidly and silently before disappearing from view.",
        "On June 8, 1964, another witness reported observing a bright object in the sky that was elongated in shape and luminous in appearance. The object hovered at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet for about 15 minutes before suddenly accelerating and disappearing.",
        "Multiple witnesses reported similar sightings of unexplained lights and objects in the sky over Clairton, Pennsylvania during this time period.",
        "Despite photographic evidence being submitted, the quality of the images was poor, and no definitive conclusions could be made about the nature of the observed objects."
