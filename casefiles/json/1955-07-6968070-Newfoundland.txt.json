    "main event": "Several military aircraft reported sightings of an unidentified object, with radar confirmation, in Newfoundland in July 1955. The object demonstrated erratic movement, rapid speed, and altitude changes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "Military aircraft, including KC-97s, sighted the object and attempted to close in on it, but it moved very fast and evasively, ultimately disappearing from view.",
        "The object remained visible to radar for an extended period and was also visually confirmed by multiple credible witnesses, including pilots and crew members.",
        "At the same time, radar sites were also picking up smaller objects below the KC-97s at altitudes of 5-10,000 feet, adding complexity to the sighting.",
        "The object's behavior included hovering, climbing to an estimated altitude of 40-50,000 feet, and making sharp turns, forming circular and line abreast patterns.",
        "The sighting prompted military personnel to scramble fighters and investigate the object, but no conclusive explanation was reached."
