    "main event": "A radar and visual sighting of several unidentified objects occurred near an Air Force station in Alaska.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were observed traveling at a very low altitude of around 50-100 feet and at a high speed of approximately 300 knots.",
        "The objects were not flying in any definite formation and were not close enough to be visually identified as aircraft.",
        "Associated sounds led the witness, an FCC employee, to believe the objects were some type of jet aircraft, but they were not close enough for a definitive identification.",
        "Doppler radar should have detected the objects, but did not, likely due to the low speed and low altitude of the objects combined with the radar's limitations.",
        "The witness was described as a mature and reliable individual, and the report was considered extremely reliable."
