    "main event": "A round metallic-appearing object moving very rapidly at an estimated speed of 600 MPH was observed near Belmont, N.C. on 8 Mar 1948 at approximately 1100 hours. The object was seen for about 10 seconds, had a bright or silver color, looked metallic, and reflected the sun with a steady reflection which did not flicker. It moved in a straight line at a constant speed without apparent change in altitude or direction, and it disappeared behind a small white cloud.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The witness, Mr. John Doe, was the superintendent of the Meter Dept. at Duke Power Co. in Charlotte, N.C., and was known to be a man of excellent character and reputation with a technical background and a conservative and responsible position.",
        "The object's size was estimated to be that of a small coin when observed from a distance, and its altitude could not be estimated other than it was moving above the clouds.",
        "The estimated speed of the object was around 600 MPH, and it moved on an easterly heading with no apparent change in altitude or direction.",
        "Despite this being an unconventional aircraft sighting, the witness did not claim to have seen a 'flying disc' but stated that they saw an unidentified object which did not resemble any natural phenomenon or known type of aircraft.",
        "The report includes witness statements from Mr. John Doe, the superintendent of the Meter Dept., Duke Power Co., Charlotte, N.C., and other witnesses from Gastonia Electric Co., Gastonia, N.C."
