  "main event": "On October 12, 1952, a civilian couple reported observing three round, aluminum-like objects flying straight and level over San Antonio, Texas for 3-4 minutes. The objects were larger than a half-dollar at arm's length and appeared at a lower altitude than aircraft.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed at an altitude lower than aircraft, indicating a flight pattern different from conventional aircraft.",
    "The objects were seen by other observers, adding credibility to the sighting.",
    "One object was larger than the other two, and it appeared to flip over slowly in the air, exposing different surfaces.",
    "The objects were estimated to be traveling at a speed of approximately 250 miles per hour.",
    "The witness reported red lights and gas trails trailing the objects, suggesting some form of propulsion."
