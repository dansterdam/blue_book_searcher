  "main event": "A civilian observer reported about seven to ten disc-shaped objects traveling west at very high speed near Milwaukee, Wisconsin on June 17, 19XX.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observer estimated the objects to be disc-shaped and reported their speed as 'like blue blazes.'",
    "The report mentions the absence of physical evidence and concludes that the information is insufficient for evaluation.",
    "Dr. Hynek's evaluations extracted from the Project Grudge report categorize the observations into astronomical, non-astronomical but suggestive of other explanations, and non-astronomical with no evident explanation.",
    "The document raises skepticism about the credibility of the observer's report, alluding to the prevalence of 'flying saucer talk' at the time.",
    "The pilots mentioned in the report describe the objects as resembling 'pie plates' and claim that the saucers headed south."
