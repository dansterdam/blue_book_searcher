  "main event": "Two round objects, the size of a dime, were observed circling and changing colors in the sky at dawn over West Los Angeles, California in 1956. The objects disappeared over the Hollywood Hills and were initially thought to be aircraft, but the duration of the sighting was excessive for conventional aircraft. There was insufficient data for a conclusion.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were initially thought to be aircraft but the duration of the sighting was considered excessive for that explanation.",
    "Both objects resembled a star and were eventually blanked out by the light from the rising sun.",
    "The report indicates that the objects disappeared over hills, adding to the mystery of the sighting.",
    "The size of the observed objects was compared to that of a dime, suggesting they were relatively small.",
    "The change in colors of the objects added to the unusual nature of the sighting."
