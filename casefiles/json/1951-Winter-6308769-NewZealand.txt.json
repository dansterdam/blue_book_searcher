		"The cloud was observed for approximately 500 yds long, 500 yds wide, and 50 yds high.",
		"It gave the appearance of a whirlwind and traveled northward before making a right-angle turn to the east.",
		"The observation suggested that the cloud appeared motionless and was not clearly defined, with some parts soon becoming spherical.",
		"The conclusion drawn was that it was probably a balloon, despite the unusual characteristics reported.",
