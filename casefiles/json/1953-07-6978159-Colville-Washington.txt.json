        "The area where the object was seen is said to be between Old Dominion mountain and Campbell peak, which skyvatchers in the area are familiar with, but this was the first time they had seen anything like it come from that direction.",
        "A later report mentioned two more people, Thomson and his mother-in-law, who also saw a dazzlingly bright, spherical object that appeared to be reflecting sunlight like a mirror and had no wings.",
