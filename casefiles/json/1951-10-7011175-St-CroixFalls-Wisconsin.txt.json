The object exhibited rapid and erratic flight behavior before disappearing from sight.",
	"interesting points": [
		"Witnesses reported seeing space ships flying at terrific speeds with a blue light shining from the craft, as well as a circular gold-colored object passing across the sky at a high rate of speed.",
		"The object was described to be 100-200 feet in diameter and exhibited a peculiar halo around it with a dark encompassing zone.",
		"This report was considered to warrant further investigation due to the credibility of the witness and the similarity of other sightings in the area.",
		"An elliptical object about 100 feet in diameter, traveling at a velocity of 600 to 800 miles per hour, was observed crossing the path of a balloon, then accelerating and disappearing to the east.",
		"A close observation was made by a crew at 16,000 to 18,000 ft altitude, describing the UFO as elliptical, approximately 4 to 5 miles in diameter, exhibiting a peculiar wave-like motion, and making an abrupt turn before disappearing."
