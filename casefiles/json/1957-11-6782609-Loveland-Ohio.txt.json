    "main event": "A civilian reported observing an orange colored object in the Western sky in Loveland, Ohio on 11 November 1957, shining rays for 7 minutes before disappearing and displaying black running lights for 5 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed for 12 minutes, and it exhibited unusual behavior, such as shining rays and displaying black running lights.",
        "Local facilities confirmed the presence of a weather balloon passing southwest of the location just before the sighting, and the report was deemed consistent with this weather phenomenon.",
        "The report acknowledges the cylindrical shape of the object, which is unaccounted for by the explanation of a weather balloon, and suggests that the variety of shapes observed in similar reports could be due to the effects of the sun's rays.",
        "Handwritten notes from a village school district in Ohio also describe the sighting of an orange colored object, further corroborating the civilian report.",
        "The object was observed to be 10 degrees above the horizon and continued to rise during the sighting."
