  "main event": "An unconventional aircraft, described as a cigar-shaped object emitting a bright orange-red light, was sighted over Lake Champlain, Vermont on December 13, 1950 at 2100 hours by multiple witnesses. The object was reported to change course over the lake and execute a very sharp maneuver, emitting no sound during the sighting.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The unconventional aircraft was reported to change course from a southward direction from Canada to a westerly direction over Lake Champlain, opposite Burlington, Vermont.",
    "Witnesses observed the object veering erratically from 2,000 feet to as low as 800 feet, intermittently emitting a bright light as bright as an arc welder's flash.",
    "The object executed a very sharp 'Z' pattern over Lake Champlain, indicating unusual maneuverability.",
    "The witnesses reported no sound from the object during the sighting, despite noting the ability to clearly see stars and the moon in the light haze weather conditions.",
    "No photographs of the object during the sighting were available, and the witnesses' ability has been described as having obvious weaknesses."
