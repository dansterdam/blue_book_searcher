	"In Michigan, a group of lights with an orange-white color and teardrop shape was observed drifting slowly to the west before changing direction and heading north. Witnesses estimated the objects to be 1000 feet high and larger than the moon.",
	"A witness in Michigan took photos of the UFO, and later described the object to be noiseless, with no trail, and moving slowly at all times. The object was estimated to be 200 feet in diameter and 20 feet thick, with what appeared to be light and darker areas on its periphery, resembling windows.",
