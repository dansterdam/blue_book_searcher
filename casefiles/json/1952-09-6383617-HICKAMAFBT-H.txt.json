  "main event": "A civilian employee at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard observed a black circular shaped object, about four feet in diameter, moving in a straight line at a speed comparable to that of a jet fighter over Hickam Air Force Base in a westerly direction and heading towards the ocean.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was estimated to be moving at a speed of about 300-400 miles per hour, similar to a jet fighter.",
    "The observation lasted for 2-3 seconds before the object disappeared.",
    "No accompanying sounds, lights, trails, exhausts, vapors, or unusual maneuvers were reported.",
    "The source, a civilian employee with normal vision, was considered sincere in the report, but no credence was placed in the report by the preparing officer due to the lack of verification in the dark conditions.",
    "No other reports of the sighted object were received from any other aircraft, military, or civilian personnel in the heavily populated area."
