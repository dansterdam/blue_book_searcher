        "The observer's son first spotted the object in the southwestern sky, and it was observed for approximately one minute.",
        "Two B-52 aircraft from Blytheville Air Force Base were airborne in the local area at the time of the sighting, but the observer insisted the object was not an aircraft.",
        "Based on the object's speed and flight path, the investigator concluded the velocity was considerably in excess of the observer's estimate and any aircraft then in production."
