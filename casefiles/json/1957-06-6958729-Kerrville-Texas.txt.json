    "main event": "On 6/30/1957 in Kerrville, Texas, a ground-radar and visual observation reported a single object, 700+ feet wide, 200+ feet high with a brilliant (orange) light. The sighting lasted for 30 minutes and the conclusion suggested it could be a high altitude balloon reflecting the light of the sun. The radar data was limited and inconclusive, leading to insufficient scientific analysis.",
