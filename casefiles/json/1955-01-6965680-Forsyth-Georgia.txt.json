        "A reliable observer reported seeing a round, luminous object approximately 30 feet in diameter, hovering about 500 feet above the ground before accelerating at a high rate of speed in a northeasterly direction.",
        "In one sighting, a flight observer on the B-475 aircraft estimated a chromic pink object, approximately 6 inches in size, 20,000 feet above, traveling northward before disappearing.",
