    "main event": "A civilian airline passenger took a number of pictures from an airplane at 27,000 ft. They discovered an elliptical object with tiny perforations along its long axis, which they insisted was a spaceship.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The observation took place between Coos Bay & Portland, Oregon, at 15:00 on 6 September 1956.",
        "The source sent a UFO questionnaire but refused to return it and claimed the negative of the print was lost.",
        "The conclusion pointed to the object being an emulsion flaw caused by sticking prints during developing, as the Brownie camera used could not stop fast action, and there were no UFO reports in the area on that date from either military or airline aircraft.",
        "The letter accompanying the photograph requested information on whether the government had any aircraft in the air at that time and location.",
        "Analysis of the object in the photograph indicated that, if it was an actual object several miles away, it would have been seen by numerous people, aircraft, and radar networks, but nothing of this nature was reported at that time and location."
