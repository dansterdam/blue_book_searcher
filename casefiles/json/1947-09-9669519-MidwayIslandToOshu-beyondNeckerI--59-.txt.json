"main event": "On 12th September 1947, an unidentified object was observed beyond Necker Island by civilian pilots and Pan American pilots, exhibiting unusual flight behavior.",
"interesting points": [
"The object was initially observed as a fireball, which is known to change course abruptly when splitting.",
"The object changed to a reddish hue from its previous color of incandescent light, and its manner of disappearance supported the hypothesis of it being a fireball.",
"The Pan American pilots observed an intense white light off the starboard bow, which changed course abruptly, far outracing the Pan American plane at an estimated speed of 1000 knots.",
"The unidentified object maintained a constant altitude between 2,500 and 10,000 feet, did not reflect on cloud formations, and exhibited extraordinary speed and maneuverability.",
"The object's behavior was evaluated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who categorized various incidents as astronomical, non-astronomical with suggestive explanations, and non-astronomical with no evident explanation."
