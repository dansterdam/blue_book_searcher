    "main event": "Two flat oval objects with a pulsing glow were observed for 1 minute in the Netherlands on 4 August 1954. The observation was made using ground-radar.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were initially thought to be searchlight beams, but they were described as flat ovals with a pulsing glow, moving at an intermittent speed.",
        "The duration of the observation was 30 seconds, and the objects were seen to move at a tremendous speed before disappearing.",
        "Rev. Richard M.H. provided information about the sighting and brought out pictures, but they were unable to capture a photograph due to the speed at which the objects moved.",
        "The investigator considered the possibility of a weather balloon but ultimately expressed doubt about this explanation.",
        "The report card notes that there was insufficient data for analysis, suggesting some level of ambiguity in the observation."
