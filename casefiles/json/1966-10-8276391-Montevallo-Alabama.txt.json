    "main event": "Four blinking red lights were observed in the sky over Montevallo, Alabama on October 3, 1966.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The first two lights appeared the size of a bird shot, while the second two were approximately the size of a pen head.",
        "The lights were originally close together, then began blinking irregularly and rapidly moved apart to about three times the original distance.",
        "One of the irregularly blinking lights performed extremely fast figure-eights, then turned towards a jet that was also observed in the area, before shooting straight up like a rocket for 5-7 seconds.",
        "The lights that were in motion made a U-turn and went out of sight, while the regularly blinking (stationary) lights were still visible fading at 10:22 pm.",
        "The observation lasted between 15 to 33 minutes."
