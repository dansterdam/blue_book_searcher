  "main event": "A pilot and civilian dispatcher reported a sighting of a pale luminous object resembling a disc flying across the sky at a high speed of approximately 800 miles per hour over Newark Air Force Base on 8th November 1948.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was approximately 1/3 the brightness of the moon, round like a disc, and appeared to have little or no depth to it.",
    "It traveled from the north northwest in an arc toward the south southeast, covering approximately 75% of its path from the observer's viewpoint.",
    "The speed of the object was estimated to be at least 200 miles per hour faster than tactical approaches made by jet aircraft at the same air force base.",
    "No sound was heard from the object, indicating silent propulsion.",
    "There was no corroboration of the sighting due to the almost-deserted nature of the air force base after 1300 hours daily, despite the witness being described as thoroughly dependable and alert."
