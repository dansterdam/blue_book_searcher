"main event": "On September 6, 1955, in Hawthorne, California, an observer reported a circular object rapidly crossing the sky, pausing, descending, making a ninety-degree turn, and then moving off into the distance. The duration of the sighting, wind, weather, and bobbling effect led to the evaluation of a probable balloon.",
"interesting points": [
    "The object was described as a fairly bright light seen moving slowly from the north, hovering overhead, and then proceeding west. The elevation and azimuth of the light were unverifiable.",
    "The observer, an employee of American Airlines Communications Department, did not believe the light to be an aircraft.",
    "The light was pulsing and eventually disappeared after approximately 10 minutes.",
    "The observer saw the light from the ground at Hawthorne, California, and there was no information on its size, speed, or shape.",
    "The possibility of a civilian blimp operated by Goodyear in the area was considered, but the preparation officer believed it was the Goodyear blimp, while the observer partially observed the sighting."
