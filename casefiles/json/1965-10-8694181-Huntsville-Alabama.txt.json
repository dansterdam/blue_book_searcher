    "main event": "A visual observation of an unusual light or object in the sky over Huntsville, Alabama on September 21, 1965.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The witness was an experienced observer of aircraft and had interests in optics and acoustics.",
        "The object appeared as a point of light that seemed to descend in a controlled manner, emitting an incandescent glow unlike a normal aircraft.",
        "The object moved rapidly across the sky, appearing to disappear and reappear, with no sound detected.",
        "The witness compared the sighting to observations of Ajax missiles or high-flying aircraft, but noted the object's motion and appearance were unusual.",
        "The witness offered the possibility that the unsteady, jerking motion of the object was due to the limits of human visual perception at that distance and lighting conditions."
