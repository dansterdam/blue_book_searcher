  "main event": "A civilian commercial pilot observed eight disc-shaped objects over the city of Spokane, Washington on 26 July 1949. The objects were larger than a B-29 aircraft and were traveling from east to west at an estimated altitude of 14,500 feet.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were reported to be much faster than a B-29, indicating high speeds and superior maneuverability.",
    "The pilot of the B-29 aircraft in the vicinity did not report sighting anything unusual, suggesting that the objects may have been difficult to detect with conventional means.",
    "The UFOs emitted a sound similar to a formation of jet aircraft, adding to the mystery of their origin and nature.",
    "There were no photographs or sketches of the objects available for analysis, leaving the visual evidence limited to the pilot's testimony.",
    "The report was given to Spokane Radio, forwarded to Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center, and then to the McChord Flight Service Center, indicating official interest and investigation into the sighting."
