    "main event": "A radar target was observed at 170 dts, 50 miles away, with a ground speed of 3700 knots for six minutes at Gray AFB in Killeen, Texas on 30 August 1958. The observed target behavior was contrary to the normal characteristics of a radar target, possibly indicating an astronomical phenomenon or some other reflection target.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The radar target traveled at a speed of 3700 knots, which is extremely fast for that time period.",
        "The target was observed on Air-Intercept-Radar for two minutes, indicating it was not a momentary blip but a sustained observation.",
        "The observed target behavior was contrary to the normal characteristics of a radar target, leading to difficulties in evaluating the phenomenon.",
        "There was a significant radar fade within two minutes of observation, suggesting a sudden disappearance.",
        "The observation was made by a 1st Lieutenant and a Senior Director at the 614th ACWRON, adding credibility to the witnesses."
