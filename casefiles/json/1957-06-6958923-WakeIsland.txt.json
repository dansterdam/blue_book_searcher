    "main event": "On June 13, 1957, at 0405Z, a civilian on Wake Island reported seeing two bluish/white vapor trails forming at about 600 feet, each about 225 feet long with a break of 25 feet. The trails rapidly dissipated after several seconds, and no objects were observed.",
    "interesting points": [
        "Buzzing sound similar to a twinjet but not as loud or high pitched was heard overhead, but no object was visible.",
        "The vapor trails were described as bluish/white, about 12-14 inches in diameter, and formed on a heading of about 290 degrees.",
        "Pilots of a landing aircraft reported no unusual observations, and the control tower operator estimated the speed of the contrails at about 500 MPH.",
        "The observer, Albers, had 11-1/2 years of tower experience and was accustomed to observing jet aircraft at low altitudes.",
        "The conclusion was that the sighting could not be identified, probably an aircraft, and if astronomical, it was unidentified due to insufficient data for evaluation."
