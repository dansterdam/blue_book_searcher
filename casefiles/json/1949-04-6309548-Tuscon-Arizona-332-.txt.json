  "main event": "Multiple observers sighted a large, sausage-like object reflecting sunlight in the sky, travelling in a curved trajectory at high speeds before fading from view. It was the size of a city block and rotating similar to a slow roll of the sun. No noise or exhaust trails were noticed during the 12-minute observation period.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was initially sighted at approximately a 30-degree angle of elevation, about 300 miles northeast of Tucson, Arizona.",
    "Multiple witnesses described the object as silver or silvery in color, oval or cigar-shaped, with no tail assembly or fins visible.",
    "One witness noted two circular holes at the front of the object, which looked like eyes from a distance.",
    "The observed object was estimated to be traveling at speeds exceeding 500 miles per hour at an altitude of 5 to 10 miles.",
    "No conventional aircraft, balloons, testing devices, or radio antenna were observed in the vicinity of the sighting."
