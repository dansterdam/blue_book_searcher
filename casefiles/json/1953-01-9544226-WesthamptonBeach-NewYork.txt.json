  "main event": "On 13 January 1953, in Westhampton Beach, New York, a steady, yellow, star-like object, reminiscent of a penny held at arm's length, was observed for about 3 1/2 hours by multiple witnesses, including members of the Civil Defense Ground Observer Corps and Captain Donald M. Cohen of the USAF.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as steady, stationary, and yellow in color, moving very slowly and appearing to halt momentarily at one point, with movements in a somewhat erratic, 'waverly' direction.",
    "Witnesses estimated the object's altitude to be at least 30,000 feet and its size to be about 1/100 the size of the full moon.",
    "The object's presence was observed by multiple people in the community, and no conventional explanation such as an aircraft, weather balloon, or any known object was given to account for its behavior and characteristics.",
    "The report was submitted to the Commanding General, 26th Air Division, USAF, and the investigation was considered closed without further action.",
    "The document also mentioned the presence of weather stations near Westhampton Beach, suggesting the possibility of weather balloons drifting over the area. However, this did not provide a conclusive explanation for the observed object."
