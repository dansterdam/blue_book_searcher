    "main event": "Two unidentified objects were tracked on radar near Madison, Wisconsin in early April 1959.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were detected on radar leaving the Madison area, going out over a lake, making a 180-degree turn, and coming back, maintaining an equal distance between two radar sites.",
        "No visual contact was made with the objects, but radar operators at the Madison and Antigo sites reported simultaneous sightings.",
        "The objects were described as making extremely tight turns and maintaining a constant distance between the radar sites.",
        "The sighting was compared to previous radar-tracked UFO incidents and found to correlate with their observed characteristics.",
        "An F-102 interceptor was scrambled to investigate the objects, but when the pilot returned to base, the objects were still in the area at a very high altitude."
