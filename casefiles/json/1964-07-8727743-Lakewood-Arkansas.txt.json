        "The initial object appeared to break into two pieces, and then one of those pieces seemed to break into two again.",
        "The objects displayed erratic motion, going from stationary to moving in a southeasterly direction before disappearing.",
        "The sighting lasted for approximately 5 minutes and was observed through field glasses by a witness on the ground.",
