  "main event": "On 6 May 1948, Capt. Floyd Barnes, a USAF pilot, observed a large white ball of fire, possibly an exploding fireball, ahead of and slightly above his aircraft between Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands and Hickern Field. The object was seen for only a split second and there were no trails typically associated with meteors or distress signals.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting occurred at an altitude of 10,000 feet with 5/10 cloud coverage.",
    "No photographs or sketches of the object were obtained.",
    "The possibility of the object being a shell fired from the USS unknown was considered improbable.",
    "The document suggests that the object was not related to aircraft sighted later, pointing to a singular event.",
    "The sighting was followed by the observation of lights on the water surface and another aircraft flying a reciprocal course, which did not acknowledge communication attempts."
