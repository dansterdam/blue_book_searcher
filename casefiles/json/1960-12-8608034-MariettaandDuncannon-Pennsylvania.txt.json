  "main event": "Three bright, white and red lights in boomerang-shaped formation were observed by witnesses on the ground intermittently for 7-8 seconds at 2210 hrs on 11 Dec 60 in Marietta & Duncannon, Pennsylvania.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was tracked on ground radar, and the radar tracing showed it moving from left to right at an estimated speed of 10 miles per minute.",
    "When the object reached a point 10 miles north of the observers, it appeared to accelerate and disappeared from the radar scope.",
    "The brightness of the radar echoes indicated the object was comparable to aircraft metal in reflecting area, making it unusual for the equipment involved.",
    "The distance of the object was considered critical, as the echoes were so unusual in characteristics compared to a meteor or aircraft.",
    "The sighting lasted for about 15 minutes."
