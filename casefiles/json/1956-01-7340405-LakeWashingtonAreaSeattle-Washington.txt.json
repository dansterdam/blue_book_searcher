  "main event": "On 30 January 1956, in the Lake Washington Area, Seattle, Washington, a civilian observed a bluish white, amber orange, and red object, believed to be a bright star. The object was seen making abrupt maneuvers and changes in its flight direction.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was initially believed to be a particularly bright star, but it was observed making abrupt maneuvers and changes in direction.",
    "The position of the star Sirius coincided closely with the azimuth and elevation of the observed object, leading investigators to conclude that the sighting was astronomical in nature.",
    "Witnesses reported seeing the object each night for four consecutive nights in approximately the same position, further reinforcing the astronomical explanation for the sighting.",
    "Investigative efforts involved contacting the University of Washington Observatory to plot the position of known bright stars and planets on the dates in question.",
    "A weather balloon was tracked on radar for approximately 150 miles, but no further investigation was considered necessary after the object disappeared from radar screens."
