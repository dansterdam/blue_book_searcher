    "main event": "On August 1, 1952, radar tracked an unidentified object near Bellefontaine, Ohio that was estimated to be 40-50,000 feet in altitude and 24-40 feet in diameter. Two F-86 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the object but were unable to get close enough to identify it.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The pilots of the F-86s climbed to 48,000 feet and 52,000 feet trying to get close to the object.",
        "The object appeared as a 'fuzzy ball' in the pilots' gunsights.",
        "The object moved at an extremely high speed, estimated over 700 mph, yet was able to easily pass the sound barrier.",
        "Ground radar lost track of the object when the interceptor jets' returns blended with it on the scope.",
        "The object was not a balloon, aircraft, astronomical object, or any known type of vehicle at the time."
