  "main event": "On May 1, 1952, at 0910 MST at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, two shiny, circular, metal-colored objects were observed at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet. The objects approached and stationed themselves in close proximity to a B-36 aircraft before disappearing at high speed in a southerly direction.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The UFOs approached the B-36 at a speed about three to four times faster than the aircraft itself.",
    "One of the objects stationed itself between the pusher-type prop spinners and the leading edge of the starboard elevator of the B-36, indicating an extremely close proximity to the aircraft.",
    "The objects were reported to be about 20 to 25 feet in diameter and were approximately 3 to 4 times the speed of the B-36, overtaking the aircraft at an estimated 300 miles per hour.",
    "They executed sharp turns and hovered near the B-36 before disappearing, exhibiting maneuvers that defied conventional aircraft capabilities.",
    "The pilots denied that the objects interfered with the flying characteristics of the B-36 or the navigation or radio equipment."
