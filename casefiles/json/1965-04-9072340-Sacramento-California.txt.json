        "The object was first noticed after the observers had gone to bed for the night.",
        "The object was initially observed 25-30 degrees above the horizon at a 120-degree angle, and its angle increased slightly with each pass.",
        "The object moved at a good speed along a linear path, disappearing and reappearing in the opposite direction over a period of 50 minutes.",
        "When the object disappeared, it seemed to have a 'ladder-like trail' with three lit-up rings, and appeared to be further away than on its initial passes.",
        "All seven occupants of the household witnessed the object and agreed on the details of the sighting."
