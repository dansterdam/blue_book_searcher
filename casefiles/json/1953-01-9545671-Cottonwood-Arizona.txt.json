  "main event": "On 27 January 1953, a bright, domino-shaped, unidentifiable object was observed near Cottonwood, Arizona, for approximately 5 minutes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was estimated to be 2,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and 10,000 yards in distance, with dimensions of 50-75 feet in length and 20-30 feet in width.",
    "It was described as having a 'wing-like' formation, moving at a relatively slow speed with no sound, and oscillating slightly.",
    "The reliability of the report was not evaluated, and the conclusion stated that it was probably an aircraft, a large meteor, or space debris re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.",
    "The witness, who had previous experience in observing aircraft, reported the object moving at a speed of 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour and disappearing suddenly.",
    "The report also mentioned the possibility of the object being a high-performance jet aircraft, which could have been virtually invisible due to flying edge-on to the witness."
