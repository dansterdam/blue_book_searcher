  "main event": "On May 30, 1952, a pilot and co-pilot observed a bright metallic-like object that was round in shape and motionless at an estimated altitude of 19,000 to 20,000 feet near the island of Ohshima, Japan. The object disappeared rapidly to the west, displaying no visible means of propulsion and was unfamiliar to the observers.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The unidentified aerial object was observed for approximately 5 to 7 minutes and was estimated to be at an altitude of 10,000 to 20,000 feet.",
    "The pilot believed the object to be merely an unusual-appearing dark, round and glowing object and therefore took no identification action.",
    "The co-pilot and engineer confirmed that the object was not a cloud or a balloon and saw no visible means of propulsion.",
    "The observers noted that the object was dissimilar to any known to them and was clear in definition, displaying no exhaust flames.",
    "The report was considered significant as the crew members observed the object for an impressive length of time and were convinced that it was not a cloud or a balloon."
