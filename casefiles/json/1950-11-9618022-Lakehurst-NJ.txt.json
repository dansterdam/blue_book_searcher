    "main event": "A Navy pilot observed a single bright white light near his aircraft while flying at night near Lakehurst, New Jersey in 1950.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The light appeared to be a single white light, close to 10 to 15 inches in diameter, and moved in a slightly jerking manner, which the pilot judged as a form of stabilization.",
        "The light turned nose down on the pilot's aircraft at an incredible speed, about 100 to 700 feet above.",
        "The pilot attempted to chase the light, but it could move with phenomenal speed and maneuverability, unlike any conventional aircraft.",
        "The pilot requested assistance from other aircraft in the area, and they also observed the light, but were unable to catch up to it.",
        "The pilot had experience with jets, but stated this object was unlike anything he had encountered before."
