    "The object was observed by an experienced pilot and was initially reported by another aircraft, raising the level of credibility.",
    "The sighting was attributed to atmospheric conditions, suggesting a natural explanation for the event.",
    "Despite the pilot's 27 years of experience, neither the pilot nor the intelligence tech could explain the sighting.",
    "The object was described as having a snake-like flight path before disappearing suddenly, which is unusual for conventional flying objects.",
    "The report lists various potential explanations, including a balloon, aircraft, or astronomical object, but ultimately concludes with 'unknown' due to insufficient data for evaluation."
