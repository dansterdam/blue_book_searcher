"interesting points": [
	"The object was observed for approximately 10 seconds before disappearing, leaving no trace.",
	"It was described as elliptical, slightly larger than a jet aircraft, and crossed the vapor trail of one of the aircraft.",
	"A separate observer reported seeing a round or ball-shaped object traveling at high speed with an erratic, jerky fashion for approximately 30 seconds.",
	"No photographs were taken during the sightings, and there were no reports of similar objects in the vicinity.",
	"The report was considered to have insufficient data for evaluation and was classified as 'insufficient data' pending further information."
