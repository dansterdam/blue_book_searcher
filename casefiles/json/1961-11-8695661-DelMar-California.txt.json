    "main event": "A witness reported seeing a bright, disc-shaped object moving erratically across the sky near Del Mar, California on November 4, 1961. On the same day, the witness also observed a vertical 'fire-trail' in the sky.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as a brilliant white or bluish-white light source, much brighter than the surrounding stars, with a uniform circumference and an estimated diameter of approximately 10 feet.",
        "The object moved across the sky in an erratic or 'jittery' manner, but did not leave any trail or exhaust. The light intensity remained constant until it disappeared from view.",
        "On the same day, the witness observed a vertical 'fire-trail' in the sky, which was very short, narrow, and of a uniform intense white color. It flashed abruptly and then disappeared abruptly, with no residual glow or afterglow.",
        "Several other witnesses reported similar sightings of bright objects or 'fire-trails' in the sky around Del Mar on other dates in November 1961.",
        "The sightings were deemed to be of an 'aerospace nature', as the witness could not identify them as reflections, aircraft, or any known astronomical phenomena."
