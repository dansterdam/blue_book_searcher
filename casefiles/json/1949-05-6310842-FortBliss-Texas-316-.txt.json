        "The object was described as a 3-inch disc at arm's length, appearing white in color and highly reflective.",
        "Witnesses included military officers Major [REDACTED] and Captain [REDACTED], who were deemed reliable and of good character.",
        "The observers reported clear weather conditions with a light blue sky and no clouds at the time of sighting.",
        "No sound, odor, or trail was associated with the object, and it did not produce any projections or maneuvers before disappearing in a straight, level course.",
