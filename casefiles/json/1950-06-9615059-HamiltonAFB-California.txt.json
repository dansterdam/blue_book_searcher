    "main event": "Three Air Force non-commissioned officers at Hamilton Air Force Base in California reported seeing a disc-shaped object emitting a blue-green stream of flame and traveling at an estimated speed of 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour on June 21, 1950.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object made five separate passes near the base, with the observers using binoculars to track its course.",

        "The observers initially reported the object 'roared' across the sky, but later said they heard no sound.",
        "Air Force intelligence officers questioned the three observers at length, and a report was said to be sent to Washington, but the Air Force public information officer stated there were no planes over the base at the time.",
        "The initial report estimated the object's speed at 1,000 to 1,500 miles per hour, but the observers later said it was difficult to estimate the speed, height, and distance at night."
