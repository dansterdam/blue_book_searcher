    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were described as being flat, with the lower one slightly larger than the upper one.",
        "The objects appeared to be golden in color, like bright sunlight on a white cloud, but much more brilliant.",
        "The objects remained in a floating position, descending and then leaving in a straight line.",
        "The witness's observation may not have been entirely reliable, as he was reported to be old with poor eyesight.",
        "The objects were investigated by the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, which determined they were likely a natural phenomenon and not something requiring further investigation."
