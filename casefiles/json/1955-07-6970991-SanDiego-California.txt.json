    "main event": "A civilian observer in San Diego, California reported seeing one and sometimes three objects in the sky on August 1, 1955. The objects changed from blue to yellow, and two small objects appeared to rotate around a larger one.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects appeared and disappeared in the northwest part of the sky.",
        "The observer used binoculars to view the objects, which may have contributed to the appearance of color changes and movement.",
        "The report notes that the veracity of the observer's data can be doubted due to the age and probable inaccuracies.",
        "There is a possibility the observer was actually looking at a star through the binoculars, and any slight movement of the binoculars could have made the object appear to move.",
        "The report states that the object remained in the same position, which would support the theory that it was a star."
