    "main event": "A civilian observer reported seeing a round, jellyfish-colored object in the sky over Freer, Texas for over 2 hours on March 3, 1966.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was about 100 feet wide and 100 feet high, and had a 15-foot circular 'plastic bubble' on its surface that looked like it had no apparent means of propulsion or staying in the air.",
        "The object was first spotted as a bright light about 400-500 feet from the observer's house, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, and it slowly rose to an altitude of 15,000 feet before disappearing to the southeast.",
        "The observer used binoculars to observe the object, which made no sound and had no tail or trail.",
        "No other aircraft or balloons were reported in the area that could have accounted for the sighting.",
        "The Air Force concluded the object was likely the planet Venus, but the observer's description does not seem to match that explanation."
