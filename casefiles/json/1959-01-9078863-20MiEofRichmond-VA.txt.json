"main event": "On 22nd January 1959, a ground-radar observation reported three white objects and one orange object appearing as a light cluster in a triangular shape, no bigger than a dime. The first two white lights traveled side by side, changed light color, and seemed to intercept the other white lights.",
"interesting points": [
	"The observation lasted for 5 minutes and involved ground-radar.",
	"The objects were described as bright lights blinking and were observed for about 30 minutes.",
	"The clusters of lights seemed to form a triangular shape, and no sound was noted.",
	"The objects moved in various directions including North to South, stopping at times and then reversing their motion.",
	"The conclusion drawn was that they were probably lights of high-altitude aircraft on a refueling or intercept mission."
