    "main event": "On September 7, 1956, at 0930 to 0732, a bright white light resembling a star was observed for approximately 30 seconds. The object was described as 22.5° x 18° in size and was subject to full illumination before tapering off. It was visually seen for 20-30 seconds.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was held at arm's length and its tail was about three times the size of the object.",
        "The sighting was concluded to be probably caused by a mirage, with insufficient data for evaluation.",
        "The report card does not contain any photographs of the observed object.",
        "The conclusions lean towards the object being a balloon, aircraft, or astronomical in nature.",
        "The sighting was thoroughly discussed by the writing officer, ultimately attributing it to a mirage despite uncertainty about the object's life, duration, size, and trajectory."
