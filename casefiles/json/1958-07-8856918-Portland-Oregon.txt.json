    "main event": "A school supply helper reported seeing a rapidly rotating, circular object at an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet over Portland, Oregon.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed for approximately 2-3 minutes before disappearing in the distance traveling in a southerly direction.",
        "The object's flight path and maneuvers were similar to those of a military aircraft, but the case could not be definitively explained.",
        "No physical evidence was found, and the final evaluation was that there was insufficient information to provide any definite conclusions.",
        "A check of air traffic in the area indicated that the object could have been a C-47 or C-54 aircraft, but this was not confirmed.",
        "The report mentions a temperature inversion at 9,000 feet with a possible haze layer, which could have caused the object to appear unusual."
