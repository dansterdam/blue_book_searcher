    "One report described the object as a white, rainbow-colored light with erratic zig-zag motion, flying at an estimated height of 1000-2000 feet.",
    "Several reports mentioned the absence of typical features of meteors, leading to skepticism about the explanation of these sightings as astronomical: meteor.",
    "The witnesses included military captain USAF A-237475, as well as civilian observers from Raleigh, N.C. and Florence, S.C.",
