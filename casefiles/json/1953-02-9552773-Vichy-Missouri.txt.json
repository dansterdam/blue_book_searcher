  "main event": "In February 1953, Major C. L. Baules, a staff pilot, reported seeing an unidentified object in Vichy, Missouri. The object, described as a light, varied in intensity and changed colors from red to green while traveling at an indicated airspeed of 370 knots at an altitude of 7000 feet. The pilot and co-pilot witnessed the object off the left wing approximately one mile away.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was reported to change color from white through red, amber, and green, exhibiting pulsating or erratic motion.",
    "Witnesses on the ground observed the object for almost one hour, noting its ability to ascend and descend or remain visible for about 5 minutes at a time.",
    "The reliability of the witness, Major C. L. Baules, was considered excellent, and no identification actions were taken as there were no other aircraft in the immediate vicinity.",
    "Although no physical evidence of the sighting exists and no interruption or identification action was taken, ADC radar stations tried to track the object but lost it as it was out of range.",
    "Weather conditions at the time of sighting included a broken undercast at 2000 feet and winds varying to 25 knots."
