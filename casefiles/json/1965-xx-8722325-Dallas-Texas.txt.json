        "A group of North Texas University students observed a large object with only navigation lights for about 6 minutes, and it appeared to be the size of the full moon.",
        "The object moved very slowly, may have been hovering, and changed direction from straight to the right and then straight again.",
        "The object appeared to move faster than an airplane and did not deviate from a straight course, which seemed to defy the laws of physics for a star or airplane.",
        "The object was not a reported 'star' in that area and did not behave like an artificial satellite."
