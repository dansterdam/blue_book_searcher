    "main event": "A peculiar radar return on the night of 8 July 1954 near Bermuda consisted of a clear and well defined circular formation containing 7 to 8 objects, observed for approximately 19 minutes. The objects moved erratically and at high speeds, exhibiting luminous glows.",

    "interesting points": [
        "The radar operator encountered the objects but could not conclusively identify them as any known type of aircraft.",
        "An extensive aerial search immediately after the sighting failed to locate any responsible aircraft, and the aircraft commander in the area was also unable to visually observe the objects.",
        "Photographs were taken of the radar scope and included in the report, but no naval activity was observed",
        "The objects were later definitively identified as an aircraft carrier accompanied by six destroyers and one submarine, enroute from Naples to Norfolk, after an inquiry to the Navy.",
        "The report included multiple photographs and film related to the incident."
