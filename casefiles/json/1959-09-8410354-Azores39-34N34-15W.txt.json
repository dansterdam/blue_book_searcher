    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as a fireball with a long blue-green tail, estimated to be 1,200 to 2,300 feet long.",
        "The object appeared to be diving towards the earth at a speed much slower than a falling star, and then burst into flames and disintegrated at an estimated altitude of 12,000 feet.",
        "The object was observed by the pilot of a C-124C aircraft at an altitude of 18,000 feet, traveling at 275-220 knots from Dover AFB, Delaware.",
        "The weather conditions at the time of the sighting included scattered cirrus clouds with bases at 20,000 feet and visibility of 50 miles or better.",
        "The pilot believes the sighting could have been either a rocket or missile breaking apart due to speed, or a falling star, though the speed was considered too high for a falling star."
