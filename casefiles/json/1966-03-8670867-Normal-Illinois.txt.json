    "main event": "A DC-3 aircraft was mistaken for a UFO over Normal, Illinois on March 22, 1966.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The DC-3 was making a low approach to land at the Bloomington-Normal airport, which led witnesses to mistake it for a UFO.",
        "Witnesses described seeing an oblong object with blinking lights, which matched the lighting configuration of the DC-3.",
        "The object was observed traveling at treetop level and making quick turns, which is consistent with the flight path of the descending DC-3.",
        "Investigators were able to determine the exact time and location of the DC-3 flight, which correlated with the reported UFO sighting.",
        "Witnesses' initial descriptions of the object being unusual and not a normal airplane were later contradicted when the DC-3 was identified as the source."
