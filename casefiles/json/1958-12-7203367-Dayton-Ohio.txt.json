    "interesting points": [
        "The object was accompanied by a muffled sound and a series of 'explosions' or flashes of light.",
        "The object did not move away or grow dim, but its size could not remain off as electric light.",
        "The object's brilliance extended its size about ten-fold during the 'explosions'.",
        "The terrain fell sharply in the west beyond the witness's house, and the flashes seemed to be either airborne or seen on the top of some object in the Welch area.",
        "The witness could not see a path of light from the object to their yard, and the light seemed to be near the object and exploding in the yard."
