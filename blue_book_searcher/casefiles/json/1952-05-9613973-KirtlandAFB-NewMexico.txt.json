    "main event": "On May 23, 1952, multiple Air Force officers at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, observed a silver circular object in the sky exhibiting very little change in position for approximately 45 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed at a low angle from the ground, remained in sight for 45 minutes, and exhibited intermittent periods of brightness and darkness as if slowly circling.",
        "Interception attempts were made, including diverting aircraft to identify the object and using radar, but with negative results.",
        "No rapid changes in position were observed, ruling out the possibility of it being an airplane or meteor.",
        "Multiple reliable witnesses observed the object using binoculars, telescope, and radar, with one observer suggesting it could have been a piece of paper aloft because of its changing brilliance.",
        "At no time was there an indication, other than the outbound tracks of aircraft, including a Constellation, a Piper Cub, and a C-47."
