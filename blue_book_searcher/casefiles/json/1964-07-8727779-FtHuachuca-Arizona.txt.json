    "main event": "A USAF officer observed two unidentified flying objects near Fort Huachuca, Arizona on July 26, 1964.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The first object was initially mistaken for the Echo I satellite, but was observed to be a round, white object traveling from south to north.",
        "A second object then appeared, traveling on a collision course with the first object. The second object took evasive action, changing course several times before appearing to land on the Husting Mountains.",
        "The observer used a 12x power telescope to observe the objects, which were visible from 0315Z to 0335Z on July 26, 1964.",
        "Weather conditions included approximately 39% thin cloud cover, with winds ranging from 84 knots at the surface to 30 knots at 50,000 feet, and thunderstorms in the area.",
        "A helicopter was dispatched to the area but did not observe anything, and the report concludes that the observer likely saw distant aircraft that appeared closer due to the excellent visibility in the Arizona area."
