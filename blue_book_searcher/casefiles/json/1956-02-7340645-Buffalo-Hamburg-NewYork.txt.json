  "main event": "On February 29, 1956, multiple witnesses in Buffalo and Hamburg, New York observed one or more unidentified flying objects, including a bright, pulsating light in the sky that was seen moving at rapid speeds and hovering overhead for short durations before disappearing.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The bright-lighted object was observed pulsating at intervals and was seen by both military and civilian sources, including a fighter pilot and a high school student.",
    "The object was described as round, bright as a star at times, and dim to a pale light before brightening up again.",
    "A hand-drawn sketch depicts a large, round object with a white center and green haze around the edges, labeled as 'Erratic Movement'. Another smaller, bright white object was also depicted.",
    "Supplementary investigative efforts included attempts to verify the sightings, such as contacting the 47th FIS Intelligence Section and the Buffalo Filter Center, but no definitive information could be immediately gained about the observed objects.",
    "A civilian observer reported seeing five objects flying from the southwest, estimated to be the size of a house, hovering in the sky without making any sound. One object separated and fell behind the others, while another object appeared to accelerate and ascend 25 to 40 miles east of the first object."
