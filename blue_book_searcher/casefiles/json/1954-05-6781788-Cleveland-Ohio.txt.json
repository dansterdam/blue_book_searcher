  "main event": "On May 26, 1954, an engineer named Ray A. Brantlinger observed a brilliantly illuminated, circular object emitting a reddish-orange glow near his home in Cleveland, Ohio. The object made a straight and level flight, then suddenly accelerated and disappeared from sight. It was estimated to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and larger than a B-29 aircraft, approximately 40-50 feet in diameter. It made no sound and seemed to be under intelligent control.",
