  "main event": "On May 8, 1952, approximately 600 miles off the east coast of the United States, a Pan American Airlines flight crew observed three round objects of considerable size traveling in line. The objects were much brighter and larger than aircraft lights and displayed extreme rapidity.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed on radar at the same altitude as the airliner, appearing as a large white light followed by two smaller orange objects with tapering tails.",
    "The first object was much brighter and about ten times larger than a landing light, while the two following objects were smaller and had amber trailing lights.",
    "The incident occurred at 35° to 36° at 15,000 to 18,000 feet, and the objects were seen tracking with extreme rapidity off the left wing of the aircraft.",
    "There was no known solution or air activity in the area at that time, and the objects were completely foreign to the sources interrogated.",
    "The document also discusses instructions for preparing and submitting forms, a report on a negative submarine activity, and a request to evaluate an alleged sighting of a rocket by Pan American Flight 292."
