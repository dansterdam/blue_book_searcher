    "main event": "A civilian observed a metallic, oval/elliptical-shaped object, approximately 20 feet in diameter, moving in a tumbling fashion before shooting up towards the sun in Lafayette, Indiana in October 1955.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object initially appeared to the observer like a descending parachute, then started going up and towards the observer before moving to its right very slowly.",
        "The observer mentioned that the object moved faster than any jet they had seen, and the observation lasted 2 to 3 minutes under fair sky conditions.",
        "The object's sudden movement, including shooting up towards the sun, made it difficult for the observer to keep up with it.",
        "The observer expressed uncertainty about who to report the sighting to until coming across an address in the book 'Secrets of Space Flight.'",
        "The official conclusion listed in the report was 'Was Balloon, Possibly Balloon, Unknown.'"
