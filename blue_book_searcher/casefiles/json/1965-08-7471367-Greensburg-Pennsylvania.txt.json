    "main event": "A bright light, described as much brighter than Venus, was observed moving across the sky over Greensburg, Pennsylvania on several occasions in August 1965.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed moving at high speeds, faster than a jet but slower than a meteor.",
        "The witness, a nuclear physicist and member of the Pittsburgh Astronomical Group, ruled out the object being a known aircraft or satellite.",
        "On one occasion, the object was observed directly overhead, moving at a rate of about 2 degrees per second and completing the journey in around 35 seconds.",
        "There was a possibility the object could have been a natural satellite with a very short orbital period, but it did not reappear on subsequent nights.",
        "The bright light of the object and its unusual flight characteristics led the witness to conclude it was an unidentified aerial phenomenon."
