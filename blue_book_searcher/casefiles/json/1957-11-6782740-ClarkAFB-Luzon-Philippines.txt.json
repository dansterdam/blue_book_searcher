        "The observer initially thought the object was a helicopter, but later determined it was a distinct light that flickered on and off at intervals of about 4 seconds.",
        "The object appeared stationary overhead at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet, then disappeared at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction.",
        "The observation lasted for 2-3 minutes.",
        "A weather balloon was launched around the time of the sighting, but it was determined that the object could not be explained by the balloon.",
