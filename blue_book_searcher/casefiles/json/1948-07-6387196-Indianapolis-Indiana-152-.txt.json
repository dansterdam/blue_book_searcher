	"main event": "On July 31, 1948, at 0825 hours in Indianapolis, Indiana, a civilian electrician and his wife observed a white, lusterless, cymbal-shaped object, approximately 20 feet in diameter and 6-8 feet high, traveling at 1200 MPH at an altitude of 2000 feet. The object moved across the sky to the east, maintaining a level course, and appeared to spin as it rose into the sun.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The object was shaped like a cymbal, with a smooth surface and no shine, and it traveled extremely fast, creating a flat appearance.",
		"There was no sound or exhaust from the object, and it left no discernible traces.",
		"The report mentions a sketch of the object, but no photographs were available.",
		"The document includes evaluations extracted from Project Grudge Report, categorizing the incidents into astronomical, non-astronomical with other explanations, and non-astronomical with no evident explanation.",
		"The text states that there was no astronomical explanation for the objects observed in the incident."
