    "main event": "Unidentified objects were found in a photo of the moon.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The areal anomalies appearing on the imagery are most probably a combination of debris and reflections within the optical system.",
        "The resolution level of the imagery is too low to permit specific identification of the areas indicated by the source to be UFOs.",
        "The photo was taken with a 650 box camera, which produced a negative that was low in contrast and density, making it inadequate for identifying the anomalies.",
        "The report mentions that the negative was lost shortly after the photo analysis was made.",
        "The report includes photographic data about the camera used, including the type, film, shutter speed, and direction the camera was pointing."
