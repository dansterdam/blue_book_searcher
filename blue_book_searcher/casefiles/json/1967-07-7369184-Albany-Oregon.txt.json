    "main event": "Two objects were observed in the sky over Albany, Oregon on December 9, 1967.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The first object was at an elevation of almost 30 degrees towards 350 degrees azimuth, while the second object was at an elevation of almost 30 degrees towards 050 degrees azimuth.",
        "The second object moved from east to west and intersected the flight path of the first object, turning towards it and overtaking it at a speed twice as fast.",
        "The objects were described as being at a 'fantastic height' and of the same magnitude of brightness, similar in appearance to satellites.",
        "The turns made by the second object were described as 'gentle S-like turns', which does not confirm with conventional satellite behavior.",
        "The possibility of the objects being plastic bags with lighted candles was suggested, but this would require a change in wind direction."
