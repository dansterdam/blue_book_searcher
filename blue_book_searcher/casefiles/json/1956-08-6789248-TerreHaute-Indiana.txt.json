  "main event": "On August 11, 1955, in Terre Haute, Indiana, a round, glowing white object resembling a disk was observed. It hovered in a stationary position, then climbed at a 45-degree angle before disappearing to the southeast. The estimated height was less than 10,000 feet.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was reported in the same location 13 days earlier, but its behavior was not characteristic of an aircraft.",
    "The object was initially mistaken for Mars due to its position in the sky.",
    "The conclusion was that the object was probably astronomical, with insufficient data for further evaluation.",
    "The observation involved five separate sightings at 10-minute intervals, adding to the credibility of the report.",
    "There were credible witnesses present, including an F86 crew chief and an electrician from the 122nd Installations Squadron."
