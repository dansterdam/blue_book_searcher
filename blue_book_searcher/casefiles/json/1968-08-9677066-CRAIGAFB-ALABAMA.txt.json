    "main event": "Approximately 20 flight line personnel at Craig AFB, Alabama sighted a white light that seemed to be emitting blue-green waves on August 16, 1962.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The light remained stationary for several minutes, then moved rapidly up and down the runway before climbing at a 45 degree angle and disappearing.",
        "The light was observed at approximately 2 to 3 degrees above the horizon for around 2 to 3 minutes.",
        "There was a rocket launch from Cape Kennedy around the same time, which could explain the sighting.",
        "The observers described the light as a bright round disk surrounded by a diffuse halo.",
        "Unfortunately, the Craig AFB control tower and radar facility were not manned at the time of the sighting."
