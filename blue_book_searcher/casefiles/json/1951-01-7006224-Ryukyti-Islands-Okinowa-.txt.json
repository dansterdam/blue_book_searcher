    "main event": "Sighting of unidentified flying objects over the Ryukyu Islands, Okinawa, Japan during the period 25 November 1950 to 24 January 1951.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects observed were generally described as bright lights, some of which appeared to change color.",
        "The objects moved at high speeds, made abrupt changes in direction, and exhibited other characteristics indicative of something other than conventional aircraft.",
        "On 31 Dec 1950, a group of 20 airmen stationed at a USAF base on Okinawa observed a large luminous object in the sky that first appeared at an altitude of about 15,000 feet and was traveling at an estimated speed of 800 to 900 mph.",
        "The large object suddenly stopped, hovered momentarily, then began a rapid descent, slowing down as it neared the ground, and at about 150 feet above the ground, appeared to scatter or release a number of smaller objects, which fell to the ground, causing small explosions upon impact.",
        "The large object then rose rapidly and disappeared from sight in less than a minute, while the smaller objects continued burning on the ground for several minutes after the larger object had departed."
