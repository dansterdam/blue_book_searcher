  "main event": "Tracking of a Titan missile launch at Cape Canaveral, Florida on September 8, 1961 resulted in the observation of an unidentified object.",
  "interesting points": [
    "A 'boogie' image was seen only by a BU camera at Patrick AFB and not by other tracking sensors, indicating the object was not in close proximity to the Titan missile.",
    "Calculations based on the missile's position at burnout suggest the 'boogie' image was most likely that of a small metallic object, possibly a gamma flashing on the surface.",
    "Analytical data from past incidents using the same type of equipment shows star tracks similar to what was observed in the Titan film.",
    "Complete missile trajectory data, accurate geographic coordinates of the camera and launch pad, and information on the sensors tracking the missile are required to conclusively confirm the evaluation.",
    "A request was made to NORAD to investigate all known satellite orbits in the vicinity of the observed object to determine if it could have been a satellite."
  ],
  "result": "Further investigation and analysis is required to determine the nature of the unidentified object observed.",
  "sighted object": "An unidentified 'boogie' image was observed",
  "location": "Cape Canaveral, Florida",
  "witnesses": "Tracking cameras and sensors at the missile launch site",
  "photographs": "No photographs included in the report"
