"main event": "On April 24, 1949, several persons in White Sands, New Mexico, witnessed a rapidly moving unidentified object, while making wind velocity measurements using a theodolite to track a balloon release.",
"interesting points": [
	"The observers initially thought they saw the same balloon they had released, but the object was observed to be drifting rapidly and had a whitish spherical appearance.",
	"The object was estimated to move at a speed of 5°/sec and was observed drifting rapidly to the east.",
	"The observers tried to track the object with a theodolite and noticed an ellipsoidal shape about 2½:1, with a whitish color, and a light yellow glow on one side.",
	"Calculations suggested that the object, if traveling at escape velocity, could have been at an elevation of about 300,000 feet, possibly crossing the orbits of the White Sands Proving Ground, Holloman Air Force Base, and Los Alamos.",
	"The report highlighted challenges in estimating the distance and speed of the object due to a lack of clear focus through the theodolite and no discernible details seen with the naked eye."
