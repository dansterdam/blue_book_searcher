        "The object appeared to climb at a 45 degree angle and attained a velocity in excess of 700 mph, and seemed to be controlled, changing direction and altitude abruptly.",
        "The object had a spherical bottom and remained apparently not moving, in the above-described shape and position, for approximately (33) seconds. It seemed to shine with a bright metallic glisten and to show no signs of blinking lights.",
