    "The object was observed in broad daylight, a relatively rare occurrence for meteor sightings.",
    "The witness stated that the object's speed was far greater than the reported 1,200 mph.",
    "The witness initially thought the object could have been a balloon but noted that it did not behave like one due to its fantastic speed.",
    "The witness reported the sighting to the weather office at Williams AFB, and it was confirmed that no balloons were released that day.",
    "The witness, identified as a USAF Information Services Officer with over 100 hours of F-80 jet time, estimated the object's speed to be approximately 9,000 to 10,000 knots."
