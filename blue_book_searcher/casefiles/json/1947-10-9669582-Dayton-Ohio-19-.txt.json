  "main event": "Two cigar-shaped objects were observed flying at high altitude and very fast over Dayton, Ohio on 20th October 1947, roughly a city block apart.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were described as 'cigar-like' and were observed moving at very high speeds, with possibly large sizes and an estimated high altitude.",
    "Despite a suggestion that the objects might have been a pair of fireballs due to the observer's untrained eye and bright sunlight, this interpretation was considered unlikely by the investigator.",
    "The investigator did not prefer the interpretation of the objects as an unusual double fireball, ultimately leaving the nature of the objects unexplained.",
    "Another report indicated that seven observers witnessed an unidentified object over a redacted location in Ohio on 17th October, displaying characteristics such as disc or [redacted] shape, light color, and clear weather conditions.",
    "The evaluation by Dr. J. Allen Hynek categorized various incidents as either astronomical, non-astronomical but suggestive of other explanations, or non-astronomical with no evident explanation."
