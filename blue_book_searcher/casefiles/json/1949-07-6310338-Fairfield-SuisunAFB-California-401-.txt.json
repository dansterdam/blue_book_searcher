  "main event": "On 16 July 1949, a large spherical object was observed by multiple witnesses at Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California. The object appeared to be stationary and reflected sunlight like the aluminum skin of an airplane. It remained visible for approximately 1 Â½ hours before disappearing in a layer of haze.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed at an altitude estimated to be well above 35,000 feet and at a distance further than 100 miles, making it difficult to determine its size and composition.",
    "Witnesses observed the object through seven-power binoculars and noted its position to be approximately 215 degrees magnetic and 3 to 5 degrees elevation.",
    "The object appeared to glow like a fluorescent lamp and gave off a metal-like reflection, leading observers to describe it as a small round object suspended in the air and resembling a silver sphere.",
    "It was initially thought to be a star due to its yellowish white light, but subsequent observations revealed its silvery color and lack of twinkle, ruling out a celestial body.",
    "One witness made a mark on the window aligned with the object and observed the object in the same position for the duration it was visible, suggesting no apparent motion."
