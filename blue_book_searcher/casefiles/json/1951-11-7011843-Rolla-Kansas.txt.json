  "main event": "On November 7, 1951, a local observing group reported observing an oblong or disk-shaped object with no visible means of propulsion at an altitude above 25,000 ft. The object travelled at very high speeds in a straight north to south east trajectory and appeared to be split into 2 parts.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observation lasted for 1 hour and 30 minutes, providing ample time for detailed examination of the object.",
    "The object's oblong or disk-shaped appearance, along with its high speed and trajectory, are intriguing aspects of the sighting.",
    "The report includes photographs, adding a visual element to the documented observation.",
    "The object's altitude above 25,000 ft raises questions about its propulsion and origin.",
    "The apparent split of the object into 2 parts adds complexity to the observation and challenges conventional explanations."
