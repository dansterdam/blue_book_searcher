  "main event": "On 29 July 1956, in Vancouver, Washington, two to five disc-like objects were observed below low clouds moving southeast towards the ocean. Additionally, an oval silver object with small wings on each side was seen hovering for about 20 minutes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "Multiple disc-like objects were observed moving in the same direction towards the ocean.",
    "One of the objects was described as an oval silver object with small wings on each side, which is an unusual shape for conventional aircraft.",
    "The sighting lasted for about 20 minutes, allowing for a relatively long observation period.",
    "The report notes that similar 'sighting objects' were moving constantly towards the ocean direction, slightly scattered, and silhouetted against the clouds.",
    "The conclusion on the nature of the objects varied from 'possibly balloon' to 'doubtful, further data for evaluation', leaving room for uncertainty."
