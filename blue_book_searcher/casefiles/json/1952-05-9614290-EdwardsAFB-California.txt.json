        "The objects were sighted by a number of reliable observers.",
        "One of the objects revealed a difference of fifty-five degrees in the angle of observation compared to the other object, suggesting the objects were not conventional aircraft.",
        "The objects ranged in altitude from 20,000 to 50,000 feet and appeared to be in level flight, in a slightly downward direction.",
        "The objects were traveling at an estimated speed of between 400 and 500 knots and maintained a constant altitude and speed.",
        "A low-flying, fast-moving object was also observed at about the same time and location, moving at a very high rate of speed."
