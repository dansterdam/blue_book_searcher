        "The object was not solid, but the shape and colors were constantly changing and dimming.",
        "The object seemed to be gaining altitude and sailing swiftly away, before disappearing after a few seconds.",
        "The speed of the object was a little slower than a meteorite, and it had a peculiar circling motion under a bright light.",
        "Two women and a man who were picked up hitchhiking also reported seeing the object when they were in Kentucky.",
        "The witness was not a sky watcher and did not imagine he had seen anything more than routine aircraft, but noted the bright lights would distract observation for people living in cities."
