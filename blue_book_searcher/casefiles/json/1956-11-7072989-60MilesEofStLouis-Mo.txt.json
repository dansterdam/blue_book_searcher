    "The object's speed was much greater than the surrounding jet aircraft, and its size and apparent arc were mentioned in the report.",
    "There was no sound heard from the object, and it suddenly disappeared as if it turned off its light.",
    "The pilot turned with the radar to attempt to acquire the object in flight and observed that it definitely was not a meteor."
