        "The object appeared round with a 'bump on top' and was an odd greenish-white color with purple lights, possibly coming from windows.",
        "The object moved faster than any jet and made a 90-degree turn before flying north.",
        "The object descended from a very high altitude and was observed for about 2 seconds.",
        "The Air Force analyst noted that the boy may have misinterpreted a fireball or oscillating object due to his young age and potentially dusty window.",
