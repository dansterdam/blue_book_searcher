    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were observed for 10-12 minutes, and the sighting involved a ground-visual observation.",
        "The objects made no maneuver and appeared as normal aircraft, except for their silent operation and the absence of sound or aerodynamic features.",
        "The objects were circular in shape and white or silvery in color, remaining stationary at times and traveling horizontally through space.",
        "The weather at the time of observation was clear with no meteorological conditions that could account for the sighting.",
        "The report included a reference to a UFO pattern-craft associated with advanced technology.",
   	"Despite being a preliminary aircraft sighting, the observed objects did not exhibit typical aircraft behavior like sound or maneuvering.",
   	"The presence of multiple objects in a V formation adds to the mystery and significance of the report."
