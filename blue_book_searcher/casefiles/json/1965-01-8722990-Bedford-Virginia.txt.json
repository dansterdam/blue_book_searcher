    "main event": "A witness spotted a large, square object in the sky near Bedford, Virginia on January 25, 1965.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was larger than a football field and appeared to be made of aluminum, glowing in the middle.",
        "The object remained stationary and did not make any noise.",
        "Two separate UFO sightings were reported in the same area within minutes of each other, indicating a possible confirmation.",
        "The report mentions that a weather balloon released in Charleston, West Virginia around the same time could have been a possible explanation for one of the sightings.",
        "The report concludes that while the witnesses are reliable, the descriptions of the objects (a square versus a cigar-shaped object) make it difficult to confirm if they were the same object."
