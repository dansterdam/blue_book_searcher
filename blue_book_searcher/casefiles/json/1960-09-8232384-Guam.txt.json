    "main event": "A target was picked up on radar at 20 miles, tracked to within 2 miles of a Naval Air Station (NAS) on a collision course. The estimated speed of the target was 2,800 knots.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The target was observed for a short period of time, around 1/3 minute.",
        "The speed of the target was much faster than a large aircraft, leading to the conclusion that it could be caused by anomalous radar propagation.",
        "A visual observation was made of a pale blue light with an erratic flight pattern, but contact was lost when the observer turned away for a moment.",
        "The weather conditions were reported, including cloud cover, wind direction, and visibility.",
        "The sighting was reported to higher command, and a request for analysis was made to the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center."
