        "Radar operators tracked up to 14 targets at a time, with one target producing an 80 db signal as it passed directly overhead.",
        "Visual sightings included objects maneuvering in zig-zags, appearing as fireballs, and covering 45 degrees of the sky in a few seconds.",
        "The weather conditions were found to be highly unusual, with a layer of warm, dry air over cooler ocean air, creating ideal conditions for optical mirages and anomalous radar propagation.",
        "While the radar data provided detailed quantitative information, the visual sightings were only qualitative due to the high-credibility of the observers."
