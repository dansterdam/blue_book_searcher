  "main event": "On 3-16-56 in Azores, a pilot of a B-47 aircraft spotted a white-yellowish oval object at 35,000 ft altitude, which appeared to be rotating, moved rapidly, and disappeared in 3 minutes. The pilot estimated the speed of the object to be approximately 3000 mph.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The sighting occurred at a high altitude of 35,000 ft, indicating the potential advanced capabilities of the observed object.",
    "The object was described as moving rapidly and disappearing in a short span of time, suggesting highly unusual behavior.",
    "The estimated speed of the object at approximately 3000 mph far exceeds the capabilities of known human-made aircraft at the time.",
    "The sighting was by a trained Air Force pilot, adding credibility to the observation.",
    "No trail was observed behind the object, indicating potential unconventional propulsion technology."
