		"One report described an object larger than a small airplane, luminous gray in color, traveling faster than an aircraft and disappearing behind a building.",
		"In another report, a brilliant golden-colored object was observed moving from east to west, appearing to move very slowly, even slower than a person could walk.",
		"The witness, Mrs. [redacted], described the object as being the size of an ordinary dessert plate and not exhibiting any tactics or maneuvers but moving very slowly and not rotating.",
		"Some of the sightings noted that there was no physical evidence, such as sound or odor, associated with the objects, and they did not leave a trail.",
		"Observers' abilities, reliability, and the manner in which their attention was drawn to the objects were detailed, adding credibility to the witness accounts."
