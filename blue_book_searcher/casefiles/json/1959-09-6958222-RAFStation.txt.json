    "main event": "Two RAF station personnel reported seeing a slow-moving white light at about 750 feet altitude in the evening of September 29, 1959.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The light was observed for about 5 minutes at around 125 degrees from true north, with an azimuth of approximately 40 degrees.",
        "The size of the light was about the size of a dime, and there was no evidence of an aircraft, sound, or exhaust.",
        "The observer was familiar with aircraft and stated that the light was completely different from any aircraft or aircraft light he had seen before.",
        "A total of 5 different persons at 3 different locations made the 2300Z September 29 sighting, ruling out the possibility of the light being caused by a ground light refracted from an upper air temperature inversion or other meteorological phenomena.",
        "The observers all agreed that the altitude was less than 1,000 feet and the speed was between 75 mph to 150 mph."
