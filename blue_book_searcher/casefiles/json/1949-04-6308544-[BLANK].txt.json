  "interesting points": [
    "Errors in identifying real stimuli and estimating speed, distance, and size can lead to misinterpretation of common or familiar phenomena, such as mistaking aircraft, lights, or birds for unidentified aerial objects.",
    "Reports may also be influenced by psychological factors such as sensational media reports, mass hysteria, or deliberate falsifications as a psychological warfare tactic.",
    "The majority of individuals reported seeing only one object and estimated the objects to be more than a mile away and over 1,000 feet high.",
    "About half of the observers specified seeing the object for 60 seconds or less, and it was difficult for them to make reliable estimates of the object's speed, distance, or size.",
    "The report also recommends testing the ability of pilots to estimate the course of small lighted balloons and suggests providing polar coordinates and size estimates in future investigations of unidentified objects."
