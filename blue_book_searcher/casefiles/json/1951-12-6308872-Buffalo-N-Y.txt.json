  "main event": "On December 6, 1951, a USAF pilot sighted an unconventional airborne object near the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, Buffalo, New York. The object was described as large, white, brilliant, with a blue-white brilliance and outlined in a fiery, tapered cone, and had pulsating red-orange exhaust flame. It was estimated to be about 100 ft in diameter and exhibited speeds of 2,000 mph before climbing at a steep angle and appearing as a brilliant, glowing, circular light at a high altitude.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object exhibited speeds of 2,000 mph and left a trail of exhaust 2 to 3 miles in length.",
    "The AACS station and control tower had no information about the object, and it made no sound associated with it.",
    "The pilot, an experienced military pilot, was unable to ascertain whether a blinking light on the object was internal or external.",
    "The object's appearance and behavior did not match that of conventional aircraft or astronomical phenomena.",
    "The report contains hand-drawn sketches and detailed textual descriptions of the UFO sighting."
