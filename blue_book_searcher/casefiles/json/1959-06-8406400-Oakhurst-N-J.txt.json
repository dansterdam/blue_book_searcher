  "main event": "On June 6, 1959, a civilian in Oakhurst, N.J. reported seeing 11 round, white objects, each about the size of a baseball, traveling in a single file formation with approximately seven minutes of separation. A shadowy object was observed in the vicinity of the first light, described as looking like a plane without wings. The objects appeared from low on the horizon in the southwest, climbed very high, descended to the far horizon in the northeast, hovered over the water, assumed various formations, and then faded out in the northeastern direction.",
