    "main event": "Ground radar tracked a round, silvery object approximately 50 feet in diameter that moved erratically in various directions, disappearing at times, in Albuquerque, New Mexico on September 2, 1961.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object exhibited rapid oscillations above and below a temperature inversion layer between 16 and 18 kilometers altitude.",
        "The object emitted several small, silvery objects that were about one-sixth the size of the main object. The main object remained motionless when the smaller objects were emitted.",
        "The object moved erratically from west to east, fading out of sight as it appeared to be moving away and climbing.",
        "A weather balloon was released from Kirtland AFB around the time of the sighting, and the report suggests the object may have been a reflection from the balloon or the inversion layer.",
        "No other witnesses could be located to corroborate the sighting."
