  "main event": "A female civilian reported a silver, round object in Xenia, Ohio on 20th October 1947. The object was fast, had a straight course, and was observed at an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The report lacks details such as the duration of observation, distance from the observer, and manner of disappearance, making it difficult to interpret definitively.",
    "The document mentions the possibility of the observed object being a slow-moving bolide, but deems it highly improbable based on the limited information provided.",
    "In a separate checklist entry from Muroc, Calif., a small, silver object was observed with no apparent construction, exhaust trails, or sound, and it had a notable effect on the clouds.",
    "Dr. Hynek's evaluations from the Project Grudge report categorize various incidents based on their probability of being astronomical or non-astronomical, and whether they have a clear or lacking explanation.",
    "The evaluations cover incidents ranging from those with a high probability of astronomical origin to incidents with no evident explanation."
