    "interesting points": [
        "The object was elliptical in shape and maintained a level flight as it traveled from east to southwest at an altitude of around 232 yards.",
        "The object was silent and disappeared from view after approximately 1 minute of observation.",
        "The observer initially spotted the object from the front door of a building, but his view was obstructed, so he ran to the end of the building to observe further, but could not see the object again.",
        "The weather conditions were excellent with clear skies and many stars visible.",
        "The observer reported the sighting over 2 hours after the incident occurred, which prevented further investigation into the identity of the object."
