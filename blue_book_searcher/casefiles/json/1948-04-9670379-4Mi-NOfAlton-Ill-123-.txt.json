    "interesting points": [
        "Colonel Siegmund and the boy both described the bird as 'bigger than an airplane' and mentioned that it flapped its wings.",
        "The colonel's companion, Col. Ralph Jackson, did not witness the bird as he was talking to a farmer at the time.",
        "A child in suburban Glendale, Missouri, reported seeing a similar bird flying over his home three months prior to this incident.",
        "No photographs were taken of the bird, and there were differing accounts regarding the details of the bird's movements.",
        "Dr. Hynek's evaluations from the Project Grudge report suggest that this incident falls under 'Non-astronomical, with no explanation evident.'"
