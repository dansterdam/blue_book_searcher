  "main event": "On September 29, 1958, a bright orange object with a fan-shaped tail was sighted near Ellington Air Force Base in Texas. The object was observed hovering before extinguishing and continuing its flight path in a continuous straight line from northeast to southwest.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as round with a fan-shaped tail, slightly smaller than a full moon, but larger than any star or planet, and emitting no sound.",
    "Witnesses used a small compass to plot the object's azimuth and estimate its angle of elevation, indicating a high level of observation detail.",
    "Observation was ground visual with the aid of ten-power binoculars, and the object was visible for approximately fifteen minutes.",
    "No photographic or physical evidence exists, and no interception or identification action was taken.",
    "An investigation suggested that the flight path and characteristics of the object closely approximated those of a conventional aircraft, leading to the belief that it was likely a civil aircraft."
