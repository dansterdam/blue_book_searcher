"main event": "On September 24, 1952, crew members of a B-29 aircraft observed bright, metallic-appearing particles south of Charleston, West Virginia, at an altitude of 23,000 feet. The particles appeared to be scattering or bursting and were visible for 2 to 3 seconds, with no associated sound.",
"interesting points": [
	"The observed particles were in the form of a bright, white light and varied in width and length, ranging from tiny flashes to streaks, and were visible for a distance of 50 miles.",
	"The crew members observed the particles from multiple points in the aircraft, and they were also visible in the slipstream and to the rear of the aircraft.",
	"The investigation by the detachment commander and detachment forecaster could not identify the particles, ruling out ice crystals or radar disintegrations.",
	"The Directorate of Scientific Services, Air Weather Service, reviewed the report and could offer no explanation for the phenomenon, prompting a recommendation to involve Project Bluebook, Air Technical Intelligence Center.",
	"The report was approved by Major D. F. Hammerlund and Colonel John L. Travis, indicating the significance of the unexplained nature of the observed phenomenon."
