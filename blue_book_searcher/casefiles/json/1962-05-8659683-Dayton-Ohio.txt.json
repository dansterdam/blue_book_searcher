        "The object on May 8th was described as a light, traveling at high speed, sharp and bright, that blinked out of sight abruptly with no sound.",
        "One report included a sketch showing a curved path of the object across the sky, and another sketch showing the object in the sky.",
        "Witnesses were asked to estimate the speed and distance of the objects, with one estimating the object was very fast, several hundred mph, and very near, just a few hundred yards away."
