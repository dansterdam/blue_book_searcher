"main event": "A civilian woman in East Moline, Illinois observed a UFO on 11 October 1952 while awaiting traffic lights. She described the object as 'shaped like a hat box with an inverted saucer on top' with port holes around the side.",
"interesting points": [
	"The object appeared to remain in the same general area, showing signs of intelligent control, and at times stopped suddenly and hovered at various spots.",
	"There was no indication of contraction or change in shape, and the object seemed to be of the silent type, with practically no sound connected to its motion.",
	"The witnesses, including reliable airport personnel, observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes, making it likely that it was a real object and not some sort of optical illusion.",
	"The object was observed to be approximately 40-50 feet in diameter, solid, and bright in appearance with a reddish glow. It seemed to hover and dart around the sky in various directions before disappearing from view after 5-10 minutes.",
	"Report suggests that the sighting was considered unimportant by the Office and fell into the unimportant category."
