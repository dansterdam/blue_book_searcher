    "main event": "A civilian observed a silver, ballistic missile-shaped object traveling northwest, then making a 90-degree right turn and continuing in level flight until it was no longer visible.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was first observed approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be traveling northwest.",
        "After the initial sighting, the object seemed to descend slightly and assume a level flight attitude, then made a 90-degree right turn and continued in level flight until no longer in view.",
        "The object was visible for approximately one minute.",
        "A T-33 aircraft approaching Langley AFB at approximately the same time and altitude was determined to be the likely cause of the sighting.",
        "The investigator noted that from a similar angle and lighting conditions, a T-33 aircraft can appear to have the shape of a larger object, creating an optical illusion."
