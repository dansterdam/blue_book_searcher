    "main event": "A bright silver circular object crossed the theodolite field of view while a weather balloon was being observed.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was brighter than the white weather balloon.",
        "The object appeared to be higher than the weather balloon and moved at a steady rate of speed.",
        "The object was tracked with the theodolite for about half a minute before the weather balloon was lost from the field of view.",
        "Later calculations estimated the object's speed to be between 80-130 knots at 40,000 feet or 120-200 knots at 6,000 feet.",
        "The observer had seen airplanes cross the field of view below or above the weather balloon, but this object's movement was much faster and in a different direction."
