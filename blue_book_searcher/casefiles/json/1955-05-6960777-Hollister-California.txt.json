    "main event": "A civilian (airline pilot) observed a group of lights in Hollister, California, on May 13, 1955, which appeared to fuse into a single object flying at over 200 MPH at altitudes ranging from 2000 to 10,000 feet for approximately one hour.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The observation was made by a civilian airline pilot, adding credibility to the sighting.",
        "The object seemed to be flying at high speeds and changing altitudes rapidly, reaching over 2000 MPH and flying at altitudes ranging from 2000 to 10,000 feet.",
        "The observer suspected it to be some type of aircraft but could not recognize the external navigation light pattern.",
        "The preliminary investigation suggested the movement of a Lockheed F-94C aircraft, but the conclusion varied between it being a balloon, military aircraft, or astronomical in nature.",
        "The report involved communication with various control towers and aviation authorities, adding to its significance."
