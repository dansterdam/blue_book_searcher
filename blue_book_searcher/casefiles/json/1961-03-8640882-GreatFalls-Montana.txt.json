    "interesting points": [
        "The object stopped for a second and then resumed, disappearing and reappearing behind clouds.",
        "The initial burst was green, and the trail was white.",
        "The trail of the object fell straight down from the burst and stopped for a second before resuming.",
        "The sighting was correlated with other reports that seemed to place the object's fall near Kellogg, Idaho.",
        "The weather report indicated there were no contrail levels, which, along with the reported initial burst and interruption of the white stream, suggested the object may have been a space vehicle rather than a meteor."
