    "main event": "There were multiple sightings of unidentified lights in different locations in Maine in 1952 and 1953. The sightings involved observations of circular-shaped lights that appeared to move at rapid speeds, change direction, and remain stationary for extended periods of time. No physical evidence or photographs were secured during the investigations.",
    "interesting points": [
        "Several civilian witnesses reported sightings of unidentified lights in different locations in Maine in 1952 and 1953, with observations of the lights remaining stationary for approximately 30 minutes before moving rapidly.",
        "Observers described the lights as circular in shape, dull white, and reddish-orange, with some lights being larger and brighter than stars and exhibiting steady, constant intensity with no twinkling.",
        "One report mentioned that the observer discussed the incident with their daughter, who confirmed the circular shape and steady glow of the light, leading the observer to dismiss it as a star.",
        "The sightings occurred during clear weather conditions with unlimited visibility, making the stars and moon clearly visible, and the reported timeframes had no unusual meteorological or aircraft activity that could account for the sightings.",
        "There were no physical evidence or photographs secured during the investigations, and no identifying information was provided for some observers, while others were described as credible individuals without expertise in aerial phenomena."
