  "main event": "Radar operators at Kincheloe AFB in Michigan detected 17 unidentified flying objects on radar on September 11, 1957.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were tracked at speeds ranging from 150 to 2,000 mph.",
    "On two occasions, there were two UFOs on the radar scope at the same time, flying side-by-side at 2,000 mph.",
    "The SAGE radars at other locations did not detect the objects, suggesting a localized phenomenon.",
    "The erratic and high-speed movements of the objects were consistent with anomalous radar propagation due to a temperature inversion.",
    "Two small boys also reported seeing the UFOs, but this sighting was not forwarded due to lack of evidence."
