  "main event": "Several sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) occurred near George AFB, California, in May 1952. Multiple observers reported seeing bright objects that exhibited rapid movements and unusual behaviors, such as sudden changes in speed and altitude. The objects were described as disc-shaped, metallic, and sometimes exhibiting a bright red-orange color. Although some reports suggested possible natural causes, witnesses remained convinced that the sightings were of unconventional and unidentified aerial vehicles.",
