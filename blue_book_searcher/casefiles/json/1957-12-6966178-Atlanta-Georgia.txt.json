    "main event": "In December 1957, in Atlanta, Georgia, a civilian reported a UFO sighting of a round object with a bluish halo and ruby red color, observed at a 25-degree elevation in the northwest, moving downward, with the conclusion being unable to identify the object as it did not fit the description of any known astronomical phenomena.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The sighting was observed both via ground-radar and ground-visual for 10 minutes, indicating a sustained and confirmed observation.",
        "The object was described as larger than a star, with a bluish halo and ruby red color, ruling out conventional celestial objects.",
        "The conclusions included options such as 'Was Balloon' and 'Was Aircraft', reflecting the thorough investigation process undertaken by the authorities.",
        "Another report described three round objects seen as stars, pulling red, demonstrating consistency in the nature of the sightings.",
        "A Deputy Commander of the US Air Force reported a sighting of four round white lights and one brilliant white light, which, despite technical interest, was concluded to be natural phenomena."
