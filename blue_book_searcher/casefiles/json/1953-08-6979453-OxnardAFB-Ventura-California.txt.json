    "main event": "A yellowish-white light of undetermined origin was observed near Oxnard AFB, Ventura, California, traveling at a speed estimated to be at least 500 knots, disappearing suddenly after 5 to 8 seconds of observation.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The estimated speed of the light was at least 500 knots, exceeding the speed of the nearby airplane.",
        "The light was observed for approximately 5 to 8 seconds, maintaining a horizontal flight path and disappearing suddenly.",
        "No sound, trail, or exhaust was detected, and the propulsion system was not observed.",
        "The observers included highly capable individuals, such as an Air Force Captain and three airmen from Point Mugu Naval Air Missile Test Center.",
        "The possibility that the light might have been those of an aircraft with inoperative anti-collision lights was considered, but the absence of sound and the erratic flight path partially discounted this theory."
