"main event": "On August 14, 1958, at Angel's Peak, Nevada, a round whitish-orange object, the size of half a dollar, was observed moving directly towards the observer, stopping for five seconds, and then moving directly away before disappearing out of sight.",
"interesting points": [
    "The object was observed for 20-40 seconds by ground visual observation in dark-night conditions, approximately 26 air miles west of Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada.",
    "The observer reported very clear weather conditions with no winds, despite conflicting weather reports indicating surface winds of 10 knots and thunderstorms in the area with 8/10 cloud coverage at 12,000'.",
    "The sighting was initially classified as a UFO, but the preparing officer suggested that the observer probably saw an AC light, considering the proximity to heavy air traffic areas.",
    "The object disappeared in the same location as when it was first sighted, indicating some form of movement or change in position.",
    "Inconsistencies were noted in the duration of the sighting, with conflicting times reported and unclear whether the object was sighted twice or the time of the sighting was between the reported times."
