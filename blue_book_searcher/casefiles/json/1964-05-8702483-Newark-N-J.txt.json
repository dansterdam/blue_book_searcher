    "main event": "The witness claims to have seen a stationary, metallic, round object in the sky near the Penn Station in Newark, New Jersey in May 1964.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The witness initially thought the object might be an airplane or helicopter, but it was stationary and did not have any visible propulsion or whirlwind.",
        "The object was angled at about 45 degrees and reflecting sunlight, then straightened out to be edge-on.",
        "After a few minutes, the object took off at a 70-80 degree angle and disappeared quickly at incredible speed with no sound or vapor trail.",
        "The witness is convinced they saw a 'flying saucer' and believes they could not have been mistaken for a commercial aircraft.",
        "The witness hopes the authorities will take this case seriously and continue to investigate these types of sightings, as they could be either secret/experimental aircraft or from another planet."
