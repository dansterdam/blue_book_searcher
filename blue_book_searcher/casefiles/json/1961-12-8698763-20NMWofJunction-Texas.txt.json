        "The object was initially observed as a pea-sized, meteor-like object that was first white, then yellow, and finally yellowish-red in color.",
        "The object's atmospheric entry was prolonged compared to other meteor sightings, and it was much brighter than other observations made in the area during the same time period.",
        "The object first glowed as a sphere, then seemingly exploded into a double effect, changing from white to yellow, and then disintegrated into four segments with a reddish-yellow glow before disappearing.",
        "Both pilots were observing the area while returning from a night navigation training mission, and they had commented on the frequency of meteor sightings during this period.",
        "The object was observed vertically descending from an elevation of 45 degrees above the horizon to approximately 25 degrees right from the aircraft's magnetic heading, and then to an elevation of approximately 10 degrees above the horizon before the two explosive disintegrations in the southern sky."
