    "main event": "A yellow, circular object was observed over Bitburg AB, Germany on February 9, 1961.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object moved in an erratic course, observed at 7-10 degrees above the horizon at 270 degrees azimuth.",
        "The object appeared to move closer to the horizon and then disappeared to the west.",
        "The duration and apparent short distance traveled by the object is suggestive of directed flight by a controlled craft.",
        "No unusual sounds or light waves were noted, but the visual limitations near the horizon prevented further observations.",
        "Several military personnel at the base reported eyewitness accounts, generally agreeing on the time, angle, and azimuth of the sighting, though they believed the object was likely a celestial body."
