    "main event": "On June 22, 1959, two gray shaped objects, colored bluish-white, were observed for approximately 15 minutes in an evening sky. The description was considered to be typical of a meteor.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The observer estimated the length of the observation to be 0.25, stating that the objects moved in a line of flight.",
        "The altitude, length of observation, and rate of acceleration led the observer to conclude that the objects were UFOs, with the closest one estimated to be 400 yards away and the farthest about 1,000 yards. The objects were in motion during most of the 15-minute observation period.",
        "The sudden maneuvers and high rate of acceleration suggested that the objects were capable of performance far beyond known aircraft capabilities. They had no visible means of propulsion, no sound, and exhibited no features typical of conventional aircraft.",
        "Various organizations and individuals were contacted in connection to the sightings, including Patterson Ops, Wright Ops, 36th Install, the Cox Tower, Flight Test Division WADC, and more, with no clear resolution.",
        "The report includes a set of questions addressing the observer's experience, such as estimating the speed and distance of the objects, the witness's location, as well as weather and conditions during the sighting."
