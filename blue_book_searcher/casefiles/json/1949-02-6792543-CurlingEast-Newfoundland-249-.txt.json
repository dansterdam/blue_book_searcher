  "interesting points": [
    "The observers reported seeing the object for 4 minutes, and it was estimated to be about 6 inches above the land, indicating a considerable altitude.",
    "Witnesses were illiterate but considered reliable by the local police and seen as honest and trustworthy.",
    "Attempts were made to trace the object's landing site, and aerial searches were planned due to the rugged and inaccessible terrain.",
    "Photographs were taken at the scene of the observation, and an aerial search was planned, but no physical evidence or fragments were obtained.",
    "The possibility of the object being a meteorite was considered, but it was noted that the observation took place during daylight, and witnesses had never seen ship's rockets, flares, or toy rockets before."
