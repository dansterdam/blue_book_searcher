  "interesting points": [
    "The object looked like F4D exhaust but was traveling at a much greater speed.",
    "The observation lasted for approximately 2 seconds.",
    "The Commander of the aircraft reported that the object was more powerful than another aircraft and he was unable to determine the distance to the object.",
    "The speed of the object was estimated to be Mach 2 or 3 if it was close, and much greater if it was at a great distance.",
    "This was the second sighting reported in the San Diego area that night, with the first one being considered possibly aircraft lights and not recorded."
