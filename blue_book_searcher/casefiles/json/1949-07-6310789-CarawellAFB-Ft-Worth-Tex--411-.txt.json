  "main event": "On July 24, 1949, at around 2030 hours, there was a sighting of several objects flying almost directly over Carswell Air Force Base at a phenomenal rate of speed. The objects emitted bluish-white light and were observed to be approximately seven in number, flying from South to North before disappearing. The observers included a Major and a Captain from the USAF.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were described as emitting a bluish-white light and were visible for only a few seconds before fading away into the Northern sky.",
    "The objects were flying in a 'V' formation and appeared to be moving very rapidly, with the distance between lights remaining constant, indicating they might have all been on a single object.",
    "The sighting indicated that the objects were of considerable speed, approximately 1000 MPH, and were observed to be at an altitude of 70 degrees initially, then moving to 15 degrees above the horizon while exhibiting no sound or odor.",
    "The weather conditions at the time of the sighting were clear with starlight only, and no clouds were visible in the sky.",
    "Two observers, a Major and a Captain from the USAF, provided consistent reports, indicating the reliability of the eyewitness accounts."
