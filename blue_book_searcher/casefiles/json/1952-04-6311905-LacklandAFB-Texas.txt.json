{
"main event": "Two separate UFO sightings were reported, one at Lackland AFB, Texas and the other in Adra, Minn. The first sighting involved a white, sphere-shaped object with a white trail moving at high speed from SE to NW. The second sighting reported an object that started as a circle, became oval, and then split into parts, all of equal brightness, possibly mistaken for a fireball.",
"interesting points": [
"The Lackland AFB sighting was observed accidentally through a closed glass window, with no sound attributable to the object being audible to the observer.",
"The white, sphere-shaped object at Lackland AFB was observed traveling at a high rate of speed for approximately 7 seconds, disappearing momentarily behind a cloud and then reappearing for another second.",
"The Adra, Minn. sighting described an object that transformed from a circle to an oval before splitting into parts, all of equal brightness, suggesting unusual behavior.",
"The lack of detailed information and the accidental nature of the sighting at Lackland AFB adds an element of credibility to the report, as it wasn't actively sought out by the observer.",
"The weather and flight log data were used to cross-reference the Lackland AFB sighting, providing additional context and potential verification of the report."
