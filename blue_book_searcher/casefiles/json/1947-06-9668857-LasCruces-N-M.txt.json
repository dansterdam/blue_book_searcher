  "main event": "On June 29, 1947, a group of individuals in an automobile observed a uniform, high-speed, and horizontally moving object at an estimated altitude of 6,000 to 10,000 feet near Las Cruces, New Mexico.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed at a rapid velocity and a high altitude, estimated between 6,000 and 10,000 feet.",
    "It appeared to move horizontally in a northerly direction, maintaining a uniform shape with no protuberances like the wings of a plane.",
    "There was apparent specular reflection, which changed in intensity as the object receded from view.",
    "The observers noted that it disappeared, possibly by abruptly changing its reflection angle, and the speed of the object remained constant throughout the observation, making circular and elliptical motions.",
    "The report includes additional sightings from other sources, mentioning a silvery sphere or kite-shaped object observed in Las Vegas, New Mexico, displaying circular and elliptical motions."
