  "main event": "On September 1st, 1949, in Knoxville, Tennessee, two individuals reported sighting a disc-shaped, metallic object flying at very high altitude and great speed. The object appeared to be constructed of metal similar to that used in airplanes and made no sound.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was sighted at an altitude estimated to be between 40,000 and 50,000 feet and was flying at a high rate of speed from the northeast to the southwest.",
    "Both individuals were on the ground and observed the object directly overhead for about 2.5 to 3 minutes before it faded from view.",
    "There was no evidence of exhaust or vapor trails from the object, and the weather conditions at the time were clear with no surface wind.",
    "One of the witnesses, an 18-year-old, had studied aeronautics for two years and appeared to be an intelligent young man, making the observation more credible.",
    "The Winds Aloft Reports from various locations on the same day revealed different wind directions and velocities, raising questions about the possible explanation for the reported sighting."
