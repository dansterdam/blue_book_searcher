    "main event": "Lights were seen in the sky over OLMSTEG at about 2230 hrs on 19 May 1952 and the evening of 20-21 May 1952. These lights were reddish in color, were seen to leave red trails, and were hovering and darting in the sky.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were seen to have wing fits and to be maneuvering in the conventional manner of aircraft.",
        "The \"red trails\" observed were very possibly the result of the aircraft's landing lights being reflected off residual moisture in the air.",
        "The \"hovering\" reported was very likely the \"apparent hovering\" often observed with aircraft at cruising altitude, wherein the craft seem to hang motionless in the air, but are actually moving, however, at a sufficient distance to make this motion undetectable to the eye.",
        "A number of Air National Guard fighter aircraft are known to have been active in the area during the time of these incidents.",
        "It is considered that the \"unidentified\" phenomenon was, in all probability, these conventional fighter aircraft."
