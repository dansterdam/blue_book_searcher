  "main event": "Two army B29 Super-fortress pilots reported seeing a huge flame-throwing rocket over Alabama but insisted that what they saw was a man-made flying machine. They clung to the story that it was not a meteor, comet, or army balloon, and they scoffed at the idea that it could have been a balloon. The pilots described the needle-like ship as a wingless craft, four times the size of a B29 jet plane, with lighted windows that they could see right through.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The pilots saw a huge flame-throwing rocket that they insisted was a man-made flying machine, not a meteor, comet, or army balloon. They were armed with still and movie cameras in case the object returned.",
    "The ship was described as wingless, needle-like, and four times the size of a B29 jet plane. It had lighted windows that the pilots could see through.",
    "Both pilots passed the ship within 15 feet and estimated it to be going 170-180 MPH.",
    "They were adamant that the object they saw was definitely not a balloon, and they planned to have cameras ready in case the craft returned.",
    "The pilots disagreed with the suggestion that the object could have been a meteor, comet, or army balloon, and they were confident in their account of the sighting."
