	"main event": "On September 3, 1950 in Spokane, Washington, three unidentified flying objects were observed for about 5 minutes by multiple witnesses during independent ground-visual observations.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The objects appeared to be circular or cylindrical in shape and moved with a smooth, gliding motion, occasionally darting up, down or sideways, indicating independent and highly erratic motion.",
		"The objects were capable of abrupt changes of direction and speed, yet no sounds were heard during the observation.",
		"Two highly credible sightings were reported: one by Captain and Mrs. Portnoy, and the other by Major Russell J. Gardiner, both considered competent and reliable observers.",
		"No satisfactory explanation for the sightings was apparent, ruling out aircraft, jet trails, meteorites, and natural phenomena as possible explanations for the observed objects.",
		"The observed objects displayed disc-shaped features and exhibited highly individual maneuvering, such as ascending, descending, and veering off in different directions."
