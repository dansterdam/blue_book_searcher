    "main event": "An unidentified flying object (UFO) sighting was reported on 23 September 1952 in California. The sighting involved two luminescent pale gold objects seen for 3 seconds, flying from north to south, and resembling a formation of birds. The witness, a 62-year-old woman, reported the objects to the Ground Control Approach (GCA) but no official investigation was conducted. The conclusion stated that the observation was characteristic of a flight of birds at night reflecting light from the ground, and the direction of flight suggested migratory birds such as ducks or geese in formation. Therefore, the official explanation for the sighting was birds.",
