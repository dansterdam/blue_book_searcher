  "main event": "On October 10, 1954, a civilian in Crane, Indiana reported observing 3 oval-shaped, blue-white flame-covered objects, each about 75 ft in length, with a high, barely audible sound. The observation lasted 3-5 seconds as the objects traveled at a terrifying speed of an estimated 1000-2000 feet height.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects traveled in a NW by N course and emitted no smoke, dust, or exhaust, with an audible sound incomparable to that produced by a jet.",
    "The source of the report is a reliable Depot employee and the weather was clear with good visibility, ruling out conventional explanations.",
    "The US Naval Ammunition Depot forwarded the report to multiple Air Force departments for investigation.",
    "The report was included in the Air Force's continuous study of scientific evaluation of unidentified flying objects.",
    "The Air Force had a major active program of investigation and evaluation of the information contained in the report, as confirmed in a response to the Captain of the US Naval Ammunition Depot."
