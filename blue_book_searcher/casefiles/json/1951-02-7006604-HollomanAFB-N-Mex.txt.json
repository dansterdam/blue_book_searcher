        "The object was initially described as having a visible shape, then appearing conical, and eventually resembling the size of a coffee cup at arm's length.",
        "It was constantly observed during a trip from Holloman AFB to Oscura Mts, initially on the horizon and then ascending to about 45 degrees before disappearing.",
        "The conclusion drawn was that the object was likely a balloon, with the possibility of it being an astronomical object, satellite, or planet.",
        "The sighting lasted for a considerable duration of about 3 minutes, allowing for detailed observation of the object.",
        "The report suggests that it was probably not a star or planet, contrary to an initial comment, but potentially a balloon or astronomical object."
