  "interesting points": [
    "The object was initially reported as stationary at 7,000 ft, then moved SSW, NW for 10 miles, and then in an arc SE to E to N to NW before disappearing while observers were adjusting fuel tanks.",
    "Pilots reported the object as perfectly normal, technical, and unidentifiable as belonging to the U.S. Air Force.",
    "No physical evidence or trail/exhaust was observed, and the sound was not heard during the 15-minute observation.",
    "The object was also observed by another pilot, who described it as a spheroid with faint yellowish cast, moving about and hovering like a helicopter, and capable of rapid maneuvers.",
    "The eventual conclusion was that the sighting was likely a helicopter from the Patuxent Naval Air Station with an experimental lighting system."
