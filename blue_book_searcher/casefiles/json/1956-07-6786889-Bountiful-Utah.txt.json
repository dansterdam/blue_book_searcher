    "main event": "A 60-year-old man in Bountiful, Utah, observed a metallic gray, triangular object in the sky near the head of a key in color. The object moved away from the observer at a high rate of speed and disappeared from sight within approximately 15 minutes. The observer did not seem particularly excited by the incident and speculated that it was unlikely to be an unusual aircraft.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as having a triangular silhouette and being the size of the head of a pin.",
        "No noise was reported from the object, and the observer noted wearing polaroid sunglasses, which improved contrast but did not impact the lack of sound.",
        "The observer mentioned that the sighting occurred at around 2315z and 1735c, in clear daylight but hazy conditions.",
        "The report involves a 'MEMO ROUTING SLIP' addressed to Captain George T. Gregory, and a document from the BAR TECHNICAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER.",
        "Despite the lack of photographs and an unclear determination of the object's position, a request was made for further information upon a sighting of an unidentified flying object in the neighborhood."
