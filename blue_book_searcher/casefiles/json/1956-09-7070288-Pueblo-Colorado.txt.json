        "The objects were described as approximately 15 multi-colored lights (red, green, blue) that flew in a definite pattern slightly higher than jet aircraft altitude.",
        "The lights were spread out in a diamond formation, equally spaced from each other.",
        "The lights dimmed and brightened in sequence, almost as if blinking, as they proceeded on a southeast course, steadily and silently.",

        "The sighting lasted for approximately 3 and a half minutes."
