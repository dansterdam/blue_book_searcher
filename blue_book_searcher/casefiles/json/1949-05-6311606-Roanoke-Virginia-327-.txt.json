  "main event": "Multiple witnesses observed a mysterious object in the skies over Roanoke, Virginia on May 12, 1949. The object was described as a long, narrow, oblong streak moving upward from the horizon in the west to overhead, disappearing in the east. It was seen at sunset and exhibited a reddish-yellow glow, and no smoke or vapor trail was observed.",
  "interesting points": [
    "Witnesses described the object as being similar to an eel, long and narrow, with a reddish-yellow glow and a tail resembling Fourth of July sparklers.",
    "One observer speculated that the object must have been a reflection of automobile headlamps coming from the east going into the sun in the west, creating the appearance of a glowing object in the atmosphere.",
    "There were no reports of radar sightings or any known aircraft activity that could account for the observed object.",
    "Witnesses included a former Air Force pilot and an insurance salesman, both of whom had good standing in the community and were considered to be fairly intelligent.",
    "The official weather and air traffic reports for the area at that time did not provide any conventional explanation for the observed object."
