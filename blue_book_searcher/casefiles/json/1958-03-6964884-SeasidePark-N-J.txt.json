  "main event": "On the night of March 21-20, 1958, in Seaside Park, N.J., multiple local policemen observed 3 large bright objects flying over water toward land, which appeared different from stars or planes. The observation lasted for 5-7 minutes and showed a steady slow course over water before disappearing over land.",
  "interesting points": [
    "Observation made by multiple local policemen adds credibility to the sighting.",
    "The duration of the sighting was considered too long for a star sighting.",
    "Analysis indicated that the position over water practically matched the sighting, but proper evaluation was not included, leaving the nature of the observation unidentified.",
    "A possible explanation was that it was a Navy P2V Neptune equipped with a searchlight or a jet craft in afterburner, according to provisional analysis.",
    "The letter from J. Allen Hynek suggests that the observation was of scientific interest and that it should be considered seriously."
