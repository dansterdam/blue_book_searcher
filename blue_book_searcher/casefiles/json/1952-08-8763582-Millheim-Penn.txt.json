  "main event": "On August 3, 1952, a high school student and three companions observed an unidentified flying object in Millheim, Pennsylvania, moving at a high rate of speed, about the size of a half-dollar at arm's length, for approximately 60 seconds before it suddenly disappeared without noise or exhaust.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed by multiple witnesses, including a high school student and other responsible and reliable civilian observers.",
    "The weather during the observation was clear with 15-mile visibility.",
    "No noise or exhaust was reported from the object, and it disappeared suddenly after approximately 60 seconds of observation.",
    "The possibility that the object was an aircraft or a weather balloon was considered, but ruled out due to its size, speed, and lack of characteristics consistent with known man-made objects.",
    "There was heavy motor activity in the area prior to the sighting, but no man-made object could be attributed as the source of the UFO."
