  "main event": "A private pilot reported a sighting of an unidentified flying object while flying in July or August 1948 between Wytheville and Marion, Virginia.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The pilot initially mistook the UFO for the headlight of a locomotive due to its brightness and movement, but soon realized it was a separate object.",
    "The UFO was described as a brilliant light, larger than a typical aircraft light, and seemed to move at a speed slower than the pilot's plane in the same direction.",
    "After observing the UFO for some time, it appeared to suddenly accelerate at a speed much faster than the pilot's aircraft before disappearing from view.",
    "The pilot was puzzled by the behavior of the light and felt there was no reasonable explanation for its movement and characteristics.",
    "The report was acknowledged by the U.S. Army Air Force and the sighting was incorporated into their study of unidentified aerial phenomena."
