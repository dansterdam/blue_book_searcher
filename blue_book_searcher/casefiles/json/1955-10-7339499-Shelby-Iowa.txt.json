The first sighting involved two small parachute-like objects dropping from the sky with no sound and a muffled explosion sound. However, no trace of a crash was found. The second sighting involved spherical objects with no sound and metallic, shiny, grey color, exhibiting unique motion and disappearing abruptly in the sky.",

        "Two 15-year-old CIC observers reported identical stories, and their accounts were considered highly reliable.",
