	"main event": "On August 26, 1952, in Atlanta, Georgia, at 22:52 EST, a civilian reported sighting a brilliant white light resembling an aircraft identification light but too bright for that, hovering in the east direction with no sound or obscured means of propulsion. The observation lasted for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, and the object was observed visually by the witness and his wife from within their house.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The reported object was described as orange-white and star-shaped, hovering and performing up and down movements.",
		"A DC-6 flew over during the observation, but it did not alter the object's flight.",
		"The Atlanta CAA control tower operator also reported seeing the object, which looked like a small ATC identification light due to weather conditions.",
		"The evaluation of the report concluded that the object was possibly a balloon, and there were balloon release activities in the area.",
		"The weather data noted scattered clouds, a temperature of 71 degrees, a dew point of 58 degrees, and a wind speed of 9 knots from the northeast during the time of the sighting."
