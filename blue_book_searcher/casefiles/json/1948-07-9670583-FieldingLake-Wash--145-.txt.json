"main event": "On 9 July 1948 at Fielding Lake, Alaska, approximately 20 greyish black, spheroid or disc-shaped objects were observed moving in excess of 500 MPH at approximately 5,000 ft, flying from NW to SE in a tight squadron blast pattern.",
"interesting points": [
	"The objects were thought to be moving at high speeds and were definitely climbing at great volume.",
	"No exhaust trails were visible, and a loud roaring sound heard before their sighting sharpened into a buzz resembling that made by a group of jet aircraft.",
	"The lack of any exhaust trail and luminosity eliminated an astronomical explanation for the objects.",
	"No photographs of the objects were available for documentation.",
	"The objects were plainly visible and either spheroid or disc-shaped, and they appeared to be jockeying back and forth in the group formation, giving the overall impression of a squadron blast pattern."
