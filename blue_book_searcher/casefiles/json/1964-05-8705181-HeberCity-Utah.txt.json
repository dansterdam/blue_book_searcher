    "main event": "A Navy gray object was observed circling a mountain at around 1,000 feet elevation near Heber City, Utah on May 16, 1964.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared round and was giving off a phosphorescent glow, slowing as if covered with a phosphorus coating.",
        "The object rose to an elevation of about 1,500 feet, went over a mountain, and disappeared.",
        "The object emitted a sound similar to a jet engine starting, and the sound decreased as the object disappeared.",
        "Another witness, Linsey Crook, observed an object about 1/2 mile in size during the same time period in the Heber City area.",
        "The report was evaluated as insufficient data for evaluation, and the conclusion was that it may have been a balloon."
