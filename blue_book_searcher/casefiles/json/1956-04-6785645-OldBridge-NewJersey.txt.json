  "main event": "On April 28, 1956, in Old Bridge, New Jersey, a bright star-like object was observed by a civilian. The object initially appeared motionless, then dimmed and moved to the NW, traveling slower than an airliner before accelerating and vanishing. The object's maneuvers indicated possible jet or balloon activity, but its rapid burst of speed left its identification unknown.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object appeared to be motionless before dimming and accelerating to a tremendous speed, indicating unusual behavior.",
    "The witness, a former technical representative for Lockheed Overseas Corp. and Curtiss-Wright Corp., suggested that the object was not an aircraft and was perplexing to aviators and military personnel.",
    "The witness drew a sketch of the object's movement, and the estimated size of the object was between 1.0 to 5.0 feet in its longest dimension.",
    "The object appeared to change direction, travel at high speeds, and vanish without a clear explanation, leading to ambiguity about its nature.",
    "The sighting was reported to the U.S. Air Force, but the object's identification remained unknown, prompting further investigation and evaluation."
