    "The sighting could indicate a non-natural object, but the evaluation for analysis was insufficient for a definitive conclusion.",
    "The objects seemed to turn one revolution for each five degrees of arc, traveling from two to five o'clock in one minute.",
    "A student pilot in the observing aircraft also sighted the object, initially mistaking it for a jet until it started to roll and rotate.",
