    "interesting points": [
        "The UFO was observed to have no fuselage, wings, or other appendages, and was perfectly round or globular, with very sharp, distinct outlines.",
        "The object was estimated to be one-fifth the size of a full moon or 3-4 times larger than Venus, and it had no vapor trail or visible fumes.",
        "The observer noted the similarity of the observed object to one of the objects in the 'Marianna' Case, except for its longer dissolution period.",
        "The observer expressed difficulty in getting the news department of the local Temple Telegram to report the sighting, and offered additional information for a news item, but the report was ignored.",
        "The observer also mentioned viewing the film 'Unidentified Flying Objects' at a local theater, noting that the object observed by him looked exactly like one of the objects in the film, except for the object he saw moving directly away for a longer period."
