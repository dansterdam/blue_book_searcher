  "main event": "Seven round, white objects were spotted in the sky, each appearing at regular intervals for two minutes. The objects were very high and seen by multiple witnesses in Cornwall, New York.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were the size of a dime at arm's length and were observed separately at regular intervals for two minutes.",
    "The observation was accompanied by fast streaks of white lights.",
    "The report indicates that these objects were most likely generated by the presence of five B-47 aircraft in the area, with cirrus clouds potentially contributing to the sightings.",
    "The B-47 aircraft were part of a big photo mission, and cirrus clouds in the area at the time could account for the intervals in the sightings.",
    "The B-47 aircraft were flying at 35,000 feet and were approximately 10 miles apart, suggesting that one aircraft could have caused the sightings."
