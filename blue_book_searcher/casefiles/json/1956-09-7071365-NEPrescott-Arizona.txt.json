    "main event": "A bright, silent object was observed in Prescott, Arizona on September 29, 1956, moving across the sky at a great rate of speed and displaying slight oscillating movement, possibly rotating or pulsating slowly. It appeared to be dropping with reddish light and was initially seen as a glow, increasing in size and brilliance as it moved across the sky.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was estimated to be 25,000 to 30,000 feet in altitude, possibly the size of a conventional aircraft, but its aerodynamic features and type were not determined.",
        "It was observed by a number of persons and watched and timed, with the conclusion that it moved silently and at a great rate of speed, but no trail or exhaust was observed.",
        "The observers, Mr. and Mrs. L, described the object as a silvery, shiny disc-like object that hovered over the area for a few minutes before accelerating and disappearing from sight.",
        "The report indicates that it was possibly a meteor, with insufficient data for a conclusion but no further action was contemplated by the office.",
        "The sighting was observed by credible witnesses and the investigation of the object yielded no data."
