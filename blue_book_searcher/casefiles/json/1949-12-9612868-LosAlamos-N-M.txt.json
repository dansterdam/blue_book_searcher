    "Pilots chased the object, and one former Air Force pilot described the craft as a large metal ball without external fittings commonly carried by free balloons, discounting the theory of it being a weather balloon.",
    "Despite speculation, the weather station and an experienced pilot agreed that the mysterious craft did not resemble the radio sonde balloons commonly used to transmit weather data.",
