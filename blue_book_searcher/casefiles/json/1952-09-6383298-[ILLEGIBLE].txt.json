  "main event": "Multiple sightings of brightly illuminated flying objects reported over Hong Kong and Bukitim in 1952.",
  "interesting points": [
    "A radio officer witnessed the passage of 15 fluorescent 'flying saucers' over Hong Kong in an arciform formation, which were three times as big as stars.",
    "The flying objects lit up the clouds as they passed through them, and the altitude could not be determined.",
    "The second report involved an operatic concert audience near Bukitim witnessing a brightly illuminated semi-circular object traveling at great speed and high altitude, accompanied by a screeching noise.",
    "The first report did not initially report the sighting to the authorities to avoid being delayed, while the second report indicated that it was the second occasion such a phenomenon had been seen in recent weeks.",
    "The analysis by the British Joint Services of the flying saucer sightings pointed to possible optical and correlation issues in the reported information."
