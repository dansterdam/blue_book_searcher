"main event": "On 1st September 1959, at approximately 2015 hours, two pilots in a T-33 over the Monterey Peninsula, California at 30,000 feet observed a single source of white light about the intensity of a landing light flying from east to west at a very high rate of speed and at an altitude of 40,000-50,000 feet. The light then disappeared just off the coast over the Pacific Ocean after being under surveillance for 3 to 5 minutes.",
"interesting points": [
    "The pilots initially believed the light to be another aircraft, but it was observed moving and approaching their position.",
    "The object was estimated to have an altitude of 40,000-50,000 feet and was traveling at a very high rate of speed from east to west.",
    "Faint bluish-green squares were observed trailing the white light as the T-33 attempted to get behind the object.",
    "The light extinguished for about 10 seconds, came back on for a few seconds then disappeared and was not seen again.",
    "The object was visible for 3 to 5 minutes as it passed from east to west before disappearing over the Pacific Ocean."
