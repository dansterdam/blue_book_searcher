    "main event": "Several disc-shaped or oval-shaped metallic objects were sighted in the sky over Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, on May 26, 1953. The objects were observed visually by multiple personnel through the Operations Building windows, and they were estimated to be 20-30 feet in diameter, moving at a speed of 800-1000 miles per hour, and making abrupt turns and changes in direction before disappearing from sight after about 10 minutes of observation.",
