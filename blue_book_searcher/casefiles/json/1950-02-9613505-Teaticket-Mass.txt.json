{
	"main event": "On February 5, 1950, in Teaticket, Mass., witnesses observed two reddish cylindrical objects high in the sky, which suddenly changed course, sped up, and climbed rapidly. The lights then scattered in different directions and eventually went behind a cloud and were lost from view.",
	"interesting points": [
		"Witnesses included Marvin Roger Odom, owner of the Falmouth Airport and a former Navy fighter pilot, and Lt. Phillip Wood, both with extensive aerial backgrounds.",
		"The objects were observed to be high in the sky, at an altitude of about 30,000 ft.",
		"At times, the distance between the two objects was nearly two miles, and then they drew together again before disappearing behind a cloud.",
		"There was no cloud in the westerly horizon at the time, and the objects were entirely different from any the witnesses had observed before, making them question their previous skepticism towards flying saucers and similar objects.",
		"The report also notes that LTC Garner, who had hundreds of hours of aerial background and connections with Western Sky Watch, was informed of the observations.",
		"The witnesses expressed concern and disbelief, indicating a shift in their previous skepticism towards UFOs."
