        "The same phenomenon occurs during pre-dawn launches, and the air force recommends providing background information to the public to prevent undue speculation and concern.",
        "Over 120 telephone queries from news media and civil authorities were received regarding the sighting.",
        "The missile was a routine training launch by a Strategic Air Command missile combat operational missile.",
        "The exhaust trail is visible in every space vehicle where combustion is incomplete, except for the Titan II 1C3M which has almost complete combustion."
