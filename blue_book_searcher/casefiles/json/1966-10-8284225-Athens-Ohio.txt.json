    "interesting points": [
        "The objects would vary in brightness, becoming very dim and only visible with the use of binoculars before fading out.",
        "The objects executed 'violent flashes' at their turn points, and the color changed when they flashed compared to their regular path.",
        "At one point, both objects were visible in the binoculars at the same time, crossing paths.",
        "The observer could not definitively determine the speed and distance of the objects, though initial estimates were provided.",
