"main event": "On August 29, 1953 at 2345Z, several observers sighted 2 lights approaching Bermuda from the south. The lights were observed for approximately 5 minutes, moving in an erratic, zigzagging manner at a very high rate of speed, estimated to be between 1500-2000 mph.",
"interesting points": [
	"The lights were high in the sky and moved erratically at a very high rate of speed, ruling out balloons and known aircraft.",
	"The observers are confident that what they saw were real, and no known natural phenomena could account for the sighting.",
	"No physical evidence or photographs were obtained from the observation.",
	"The objects' maneuvers were too high for any known aircraft and not characteristic of any known natural phenomena.",
	"The observation was conducted in a visual manner, with no physical evidence to support the sighting."
