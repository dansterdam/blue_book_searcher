    "main event": "Two boys, aged 16 and 18, observed a luminescent 'blob' rise from the ground and ascend with accelerating speed in Fargo, North Dakota on February 22, 1957.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object emitted light intermittently and displayed a red glow.",
        "The object descended slightly and then resumed its ascent, disappearing at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet.",
        "The boys' accounts vary slightly but indicate the general shape and size (estimated diameter of roughly spherical glow).",
        "It was impossible to obtain satisfactory photographs due to the extreme speed of the object and unpreparedness of the observers.",
        "Plasma ball is considered as a possible explanation, but investigators were somewhat doubtful."
