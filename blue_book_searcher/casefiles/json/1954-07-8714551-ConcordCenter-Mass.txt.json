    "main event": "On 3rd July 1954, in Concord Center, Mass., there was a ground-visual observation of lights traveling at high speed in a circular motion, pulsating, hovering, and reversing course for approximately 20 minutes. The observation involved one to several round objects of lights, with no sound accompanying them. It was concluded to have insufficient data for evaluation.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The sighting involved unusual lights described as circular in shape, whitish in color with rounded edges, traveling at very high speeds in a circular pattern, stopping, and then moving in the opposite direction.",
        "The lights were visible for about 25 minutes, directly over Concord Center Mass.",
        "There was no sound accompanying the lights, and no knowledge of where they disappeared, with trees obstructing the view.",
        "Surface winds were reported to be westerly at 9 to 14 knots at scattered heights of 12,000 ft at the time of the sighting.",
        "The observer was uncertain whether the lights were a result of the searchlights initially, but appeared to have discussed the sighting with neighbors in the area."
