    "main event": "On September 7, 1956, a circular-shaped object, red on the inside and green on the outside, was observed on the ground-radar moving laterally at approximately 45 mph in Henderson Harbor, New York. The object disappeared after approximately 45 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was detected by ground-radar and observed for 45 minutes by both civilian and military sources.",
        "The wind direction, course, and manner of disappearance led to the possibility that the object was caused by some other aerial object rather than a balloon.",
        "A/C C/JJA-1 obtained visual contact with the object, which was evaluated as possibly a star or balloon.",
        "A/2C Robert Myers, using field glasses, observed the object to move at a rapid pace and finally disappear, actions not characteristic of a star.",
        "Various members of the 655th AC&W Squadron, including a student from Syracuse, were reliable witnesses to the sighting."
