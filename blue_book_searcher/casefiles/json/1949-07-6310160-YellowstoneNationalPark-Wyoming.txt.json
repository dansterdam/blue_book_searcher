  "main event": "On July 8, 1949, in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, a couple observed eight round, bright metal objects flying at an estimated altitude of 800 to 1000 ft for around 30 minutes. The Air Force later concluded that these sightings were likely the result of misinterpretation of various conventional objects, mass hysteria, or hoaxes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The couple observed eight round objects, each about 20 ft in diameter, resembling a flock of blackbirds in a group.",
    "The objects did not emit any smoke or exhaust and appeared to be sailing at a fast speed, maneuvering like smaller birds flying in a group.",
    "One of the objects turned over and sailed among the others without making contact, exhibiting advanced aerial maneuverability.",
    "The couple described the objects as similar to a lid from a can and estimated them to be large enough to carry one or more men aboard.",
    "Despite the clear conditions and their own sobriety, the couple's report was part of the widespread 'flying saucer' rumors that the Air Force later concluded to be the result of misinterpretations, mass hysteria, or hoaxes."
