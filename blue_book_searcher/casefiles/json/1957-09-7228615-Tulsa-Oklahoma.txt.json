  "main event": "An unidentified object was observed over Tulsa, Oklahoma on September 15, 1957, traveling at an estimated speed of over 23,000 miles per hour.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as bright silver in color and approximately 60 feet in diameter.",
    "The object was tracked on radar at an estimated speed of 24,000 miles per hour, traveling from north to south.",
    "The radar used was a component of the APS-64 ground-controlled interception system, which normally only receives reflections from objects below it, making it unlikely that the object was an aircraft.",

    "The report was evaluated by the USAF and it was concluded that the observed object was likely caused by a malfunction of the observer's vision."
