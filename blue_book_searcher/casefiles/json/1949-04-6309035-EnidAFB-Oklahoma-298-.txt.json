  "main event": "On April 21, 1949, at approximately 2140 CST, a white opalescent ball with a tail was sighted at Enid Air Force Base, Oklahoma, flying from east to west at supersonic speed before fading from view after approximately 2 seconds of observation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was initially thought to be an aircraft due to its level flight and altitude, but its long tail made it appear to be a comet, which was ruled out due to its horizontal trajectory and low altitude.",
    "It was estimated to be approximately 2000 feet away from the observer and had the appearance of a large, opalescent light globe when viewed from a distance of fifteen feet.",
    "The object was reported to have jet exhaust and left a light trail approximately 100 feet in length, but no evidence of exhaust smoke was noted.",
    "The witness, a USAF pilot with combat experience, described the object's rapid speed, estimated at approximately 1,000 miles per hour, and reported that it faded from view without exploding or coming in contact with other objects.",
    "The witness's observations were deemed reliable, and the report was forwarded as a supplementary report concerning an Unconventional Aircraft to the Commanding General at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base."
