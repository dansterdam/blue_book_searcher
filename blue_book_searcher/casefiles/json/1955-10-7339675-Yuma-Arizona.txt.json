    "main event": "A bright yellow light was spotted traveling in a zig-zag formation with a side 'V' shape, with 3 of the outer lights appearing to be echelon. The lights grew dimmer and then faded.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was observed for approximately 12 seconds.",
        "The observer had the impression the object was at a very high altitude.",
        "A rapidly moving, brilliant white light was observed low in the east-southeast sky that appeared to change course erratically and hovered at a high altitude.",
        "The irregularity of the course and the fact that it hovered at low and high altitudes argues against it being astronomical or an aircraft.",
        "The report states that the observational data indicates the object was possibly astronomical or possibly an aircraft, but the irregular course and hovering suggest these explanations do not fully account for the sighting."
