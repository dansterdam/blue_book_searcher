    "main event": "A civilian observer spotted an unidentified flying object near Milledgeville, Georgia on May 3, 1966.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was saucer-shaped, slightly more oval on top than on the bottom, and made of aluminum/silvery material that did not glow or change color except when reflecting the sun.",
        "The object was initially stationary, then moved directly away at about the same altitude, decreasing in size from the size of a dime to the size of a BB shot.",
        "The object then shot straight up about 2.5 miles to a higher altitude of around 1,000 feet before moving slightly northeast and disappearing into a cumulus cloud.",
        "The observer stated that the object's performance was unlike any known aircraft, and that he clearly saw the outline of the object, which was larger than an aircraft or balloon.",
        "No other reports of UFOs were made to the local police at the time."
