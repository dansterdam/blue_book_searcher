    "main event": "An unidentified object was detected by air defense radar for over 1 hour and 54 minutes in the vicinity of Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was initially detected at an altitude of 47,000 feet and moved generally eastward at a speed of 72 knots.",
        "The object exhibited a 'ballistic type trajectory' with several dips and loops, indicating possible difficulty maintaining control or guidance.",
        "Attempts were made to intercept the object with two fighter jets, but no visual contact was made despite the pilots being able to 'lock on' to the radar return.",
        "The report suggests the object could have been a weather balloon released from Lockheed AFB in Maine, as the timing and wind conditions at the time would have placed a balloon in the vicinity of the sighting.",
        "The report concludes that while the identity of the object could not be positively determined, the available evidence points to it being a wind-borne, lighter-than-air object, likely a weather balloon."
