	"main event": "Multiple reports and radar data detailing an unidentified aerial object over the Yellow Sea in 1951, including descriptions of a saucer-shaped object, visual and radar contact, and rapid acceleration and deceleration.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The object was observed to be saucer-shaped, approximately 60 feet in diameter, with no wings, fins, or visible propulsion system.",
		"Military personnel reported the object to be very bright, causing observers to shield their eyes, and it accelerated rapidly to escape visual range.",
		"Radar contact was made and held continuously until the object disappeared, confirming the visual sighting from 25,000 yards to about 8,000 yards, but was lost as the object may have turned or descended below the radar beam return.",
		"A sketch made by the patrol plane commander depicts the object as disc-shaped, bright, and with a pulsating light, while radar plots of the object are included as enclosures.",
		"The report suggests the difficulty in obtaining precise data due to visual limitations and substantial variations in reports of speed and altitude, and it raises the possibility of the object being a new type of aircraft or special-purpose missile."
