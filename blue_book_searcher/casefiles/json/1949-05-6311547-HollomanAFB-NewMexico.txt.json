  "main event": "Two unidentified objects, described as white with a greenish tinge and shaped like fuzzy stars, were observed for about 4 minutes at Holloman AFB, New Mexico on May 12, 1949. The observer, Dr. Menzel of Harvard, believed it to be some sort of astronomical phenomena.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were estimated to be at least 150 miles away and had a separation in space of at least 9 miles, with a diameter of about 3/4 of a mile.",
    "The observer noted that the objects endured for about 4 minutes, during which the car covered at least 3 miles, and the direction of the objects did not change by more than 20Â°, indicating their stationary nature.",
    "The observer speculated that the phenomenon could have a simple explanation, but there was no completely satisfactory theory available at that time.",
    "The report mentioned the presence of a pair of star-like, fuzzy objects and the observer's initial confusion with identifying them as Castor and Pollux of Gemini due to their unusual behavior.",
    "The phenomenon was observed in a car traveling at 50 miles per hour, and the observer described the behavior of the objects as unusual, indicating the exceptional nature of the sighting."
