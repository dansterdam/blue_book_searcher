    "main event": "A group of boys watching fireworks in Greensboro, North Carolina on July 3, 1963 spotted a large yellow or orange object with a row of red lights at the perimeter, which hovered and then rapidly ascended.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was about a mile away at treetop level and its size and pattern of flight suggested it was not a conventional craft.",
        "The object seemed to move in a reversed direction as it picked up speed and then assumed a saucer-like shape before going straight up.",
        "The sky was clear and somewhat lit up from the nearby fireworks display.",
        "The witness was familiar with observing stars and meteors, but had not seen anything like this object before.",
        "The sighting was reported to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in March 1963, several months after the initial observation."
