    "main event": "A farmer spotted an unusual object on the ground near Kearney, Nebraska in 1957. He approached the object, which appeared to be a metallic, 100-foot long craft resting on four legs. Two men emerged from the craft and paralyzed him with a beam of light before allowing him to enter the craft, where he conversed with four other occupants.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The farmer's car engine died when he approached the craft.",
        "The craft's interior was transparent, allowing the farmer to see the surrounding countryside.",
        "The two men who emerged from the craft spoke to the farmer in English, telling him they meant no harm.",
        "The other four occupants of the craft, two men and two women, spoke to each other in a language the farmer described as 'high German'.",
        "The craft rose slowly into the air and disappeared after the farmer exited."
