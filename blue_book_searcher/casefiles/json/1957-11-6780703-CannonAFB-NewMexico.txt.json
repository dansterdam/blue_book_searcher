    "main event": "On November 6, 1957, at Cannon AFB, New Mexico, a military radar detected an unidentified object, described as slow-moving and approximately the size of 17 satellites. The radar tracked the object from WSW to NE at a distance of 15-20 NM east of the station.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The radar sighting indicated a slow-moving craft of significant size, with radar returns similar to the size of satellites.",
        "The radar scope tracked the unidentified craft from 12 miles bearing 270 from the field to 14 miles east, and the search scope was tilted 30 degrees during the observation.",
        "There were observations of targets moving at high speeds, approximately 200 mph, which were compared to the characteristics of flights such as migratory birds and low-flying jets.",
        "The sighting occurred under low overcast weather conditions with good visibility and light wind, ruling out weather anomalies as the cause of the radar detection.",
        "The military report concludes with the intelligence officer stating that the possibility of threats and misidentifications was not discounted, but no explanation could be provided for the sighting."
