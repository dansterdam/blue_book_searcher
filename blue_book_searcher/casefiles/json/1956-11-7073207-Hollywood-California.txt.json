"main event": "A triangular shaped gray-black object, the size of a jet plane, was observed traveling southeast in a straight line over Hollywood, California, and faded after being visually observed for one minute.",
"interesting points": [
    "The object was observed for a relatively short duration of one minute.",
    "The report indicates that 20% of photos were taken, yet there are no photographs present on the page.",
    "Despite the conclusion that the sighting was likely caused by an aircraft, the possibility of it being an A.F. jet is deemed extremely thin due to the absence of sound.",
    "The object's size being described as that of a jet plane adds credibility to the observation.",
    "The report notes that all local towers were checked for information, but no clear explanation was found."
