    "main event": "An object was observed for 20-25 minutes. The object first appeared as a white light, then changed to an amber color. The object was then seen to break up into several smaller pieces before disappearing.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was possibly some type of aircraft, and the breaking up into smaller pieces may have been caused by a malfunction or disintegration.",
        "The observer was confident the object was not a conventional aircraft or astronomical phenomenon, as it accelerated rapidly and exhibited speeds and maneuvers that were unusual.",
        "The object was initially thought to be a falling star, but it then leveled off and was observed for several minutes, which is not typical of a meteor.",
        "There were no planes in the immediate vicinity during the sighting times, but planes did land at a nearby air force base before and after the sighting.",
        "The description of a "blue-white glow" does not necessarily rule out an aircraft, as the lighting of a landing aircraft can appear similar."
