    "The witness observed a balloon-like object traveling in a westerly direction, followed by a second object from the south that circled the first before both proceeded together.",
    "Fleet Weather Central released a radiosonde, a balloon with a box attached, on the same day, which could have been mistaken for the observed objects.",
    "The witness adamantly denied mistaking the radiosonde for the objects and described seeing two distinct balloon-like objects.",
    "Official sources could not provide an explanation for the origin of the 'balloons' sighted by the witness.",
    "The witness's observation was during a time when wind conditions above Oahu showed varying wind speeds at different altitudes."
