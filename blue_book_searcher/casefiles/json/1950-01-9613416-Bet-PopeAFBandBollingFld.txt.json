	"main event": "Pilots and a passenger aboard a C-45 aircraft observed an unidentified flying object on January 24, 1950, between Pope AFB and Bolling AFB. The object appeared to be a spheroid in shape, 200-250' in diameter, with a large black object hanging below it. Its movements were described as smooth and evasive, capable of speeds from nothing to more than 300 miles per hour.",
	"interesting points": [
		"The object appeared to have a black trail following it, which was three to four times as long as the object's diameter, precipitating at the end of the smoke trail.",
		"The object was observed to move smoothly with and against the wind at will, with no evidence of being a cloud, meteor, or celestial planet.",
		"The pilots and passenger estimated the object's distance to be 40 miles away, with an altitude of 5,000 ft.",
		"The sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes, during which the object disappeared and reappeared at different locations and seemed to oscillate and wiggle.",
		"The observers, including the pilots, were described as sincere, experienced, and mature, with sufficient flying hours to be trained in observation and description."
