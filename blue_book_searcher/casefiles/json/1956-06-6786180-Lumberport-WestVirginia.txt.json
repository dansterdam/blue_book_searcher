    "main event": "In June 1956 in Lumberport, West Virginia, a civilian reported seeing a bright silvery object resembling a tear drop shape flying at an altitude of 8,000 ft towards the west at the speed of a one-engine airplane.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The report was made in 1960 about an object observed in 1956 by an 8-year-old witness.",
        "The object was probably misinterpreted as an aircraft based on its speed, flight, and general description.",
        "In a separate report from 1953, a 12-year-old witness claimed to have seen an oblong, cigar-shaped white object standing dead at an altitude of 500 ft, with the speed of a one-engine airplane.",
        "The attached letter from the witness in 1960 provided insufficient information for a valid conclusion, prompting a request to complete an Air Force questionnaire regarding the sighting.",
        "The civilian report was filed with the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio."
