  "main event": "On 27 May 1949, a civilian pilot flying from Red Bluff, California to Burns, Oregon, observed multiple unidentified flying objects in the sky. The objects were described as elongated oval, solid, unpainted metal, and flying in formation at fast and steady speeds.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observer saw 5 to 7 objects flying in formation, some appearing to change their course while paralleling the pilot's.",
    "The objects were observed to be considerably smaller than a fighter plane and had a solid configuration, appearing definitely solid - there was nothing ethereal about them.",
    "The estimated speed of the objects varied between 190 to 260 MPH, and they were traveling faster than a group of birds, but slower than jet planes.",
    "There was no change in altitude of the formation, with consistent spacing between the objects, and they appeared to keep their formation evenly and steadily.",
    "The sighting occurred over a sparsely populated valley with ranches and few automobiles on the dirt roads, and no other aircraft or automobiles were observed in the valley during the sighting."
