        "The report mentions a series of small, bright lights coming from a metallic, cigar-shaped object that is hovering over an adjacent field.",
        "The object is emitting a pulsating light, varying in intensity, and appears to be reflecting the sun's rays, indicating a metallic surface.",
        "The observer is convinced that the object is not a conventional aircraft, and it shows no signs of leaving the area after being observed for over 15 minutes."
