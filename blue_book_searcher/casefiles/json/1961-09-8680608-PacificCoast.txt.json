    "main event": "Radar operators sighted multiple high-speed unidentified objects over the Pacific Ocean on September 27, 1961.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The radar operators initially sighted five objects, four heading 330 degrees and one heading 030 degrees, moving at a high rate of speed and disappearing into sea clutter.",
        "Three minutes later, two objects appeared heading 030 degrees, moved across the radar scope, and disappeared into sea clutter. One of these objects was measured at a speed of 1,900 knots over a distance of 22 nautical miles.",
        "After the two objects disappeared, a single stationary object appeared, then moved on a heading of 265 degrees at a speed of 60 knots before being lost in the sea clutter.",
        "The radar equipment used was the APS-95 stabilized system, and the objects could only be painted with IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) on.",
        "The weather was clear with no temperature inversion, and the only known traffic in the area was a group of seven U.S. Navy ships, which were visually sighted by the radar operators."
