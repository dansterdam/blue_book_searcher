  "main event": "On 15th October 1952 at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, a radar operator observed unidentified luminous objects resembling light on radar screens, traveling at 50-70 mph at an altitude of 200,000 feet. The sightings lasted for three hours with no visual contact made.",

  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed on precision radar scopes for a duration of 3 hours, moving at speeds of 50-70 mph at a very high altitude of 200,000 feet and appeared as white luminous balls about 8 feet in diameter.",
    "There was no logical explanation such as a weather balloon, aircraft, or other known object for the observed objects.",
    "The witnesses described the objects as circular or oval in shape, estimated to be the size of a B-29 bomber, and gave off a bluish-white light that changed to a reddish-orange color as they moved.",
    "The radar scopes tracked the objects between 200 and 500 feet above the surface, usually disappearing in ground clutter, and the weather at the time of observation was described as clear with no visibility issues.",
    "Multiple witnesses reported seeing the objects, including pilots of F-86 aircraft and radar operators, and no physical evidence such as fragments or photographs was obtained."
