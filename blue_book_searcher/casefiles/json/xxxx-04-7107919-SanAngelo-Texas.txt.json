        "A few minutes later, another identical object appeared and did exactly the same thing.",
        "About two minutes after the second object disappeared, one of them came back up and hovered, then moved slightly to the west and set down out of sight.",
        "The objects were illuminated by white and blue lights, and turned bright red as they moved.",
        "The sighting occurred in an area of high intensity student aircraft activity, and the description is consistent with that of an aircraft."
