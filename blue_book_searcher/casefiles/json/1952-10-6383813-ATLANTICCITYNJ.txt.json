  "main event": "On October 12, 1952, a brilliant white object, circular to egg-shaped, was sighted about 25 miles North of Atlantic City, New Jersey, at approximately 50,000 feet. The GCI station vectored an aircraft toward the object, but the aircraft did not get any closer to it. The object displayed a gradual change in position and elevation over the course of approximately 10 minutes, resembling an F-86 aircraft standing on its nose with a mid-wing and tail or cone-shaped section of the same brilliant white light.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The unidentified object was observed for about 20 minutes and could not be picked up by aircraft radar.",
    "Both the pilot and radar observer described the object as circular to egg-shaped with a mid-wing and a tail or cone-shaped section of the same brilliant white light.",
    "The object displayed no contrails, sound, or maneuvers during the sighting.",
    "The observers suggested that the tail of white light projected below the object could have been an exhaust, but there was no indication of propulsion methods.",
    "The GCI station eventually lost contact with the object, and no photographs were taken during the sighting."
