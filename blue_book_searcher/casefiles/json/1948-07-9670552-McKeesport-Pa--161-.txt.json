    "main event": "Two untrained, uncritical, and excitable observers reported seeing a 'big, silver plate' flying noiselessly overhead in the direction of Kennywood Park in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 1948. The disc was about 12 to 15 inches in diameter and disappeared into a cloud bank before reappearing on the far side.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as a 'big, silver plate' and resembled a flying saucer.",
        "The witnesses reported that the disc disappeared into a cloud bank but reappeared on the far side before disappearing from sight.",
        "The sighting lasted for about 12-15 minutes.",
        "The report mentions that the information offered by the witnesses can be given little weight because they are described as untrained, uncritical, and excitable.",
        "The witnesses were female civilians, and the report dismisses their observation as likely being ordinary aircraft with sunlight reflected from the fuselage but not from wings."
