        "The object was observed by the commanding officer, executive officer, and several senior officers.",
        "The object had an unusual almost horizontal trajectory, brilliant blue color, and apparent nearness that was different from typical aircraft or missile sightings.",
        "The object descended at a steep angle, made an arc of about 25-30 degrees, and then reappeared a few seconds later, flashing brilliantly before vanishing.",
        "The report states the object had all the characteristics of a meteor sighting, with the brightness being attributed to the nearness of the object and reflected trajectory.",
        "The report concluded the object was likely a meteor, despite the horizontal trajectory, since this does not rule out a meteor."
