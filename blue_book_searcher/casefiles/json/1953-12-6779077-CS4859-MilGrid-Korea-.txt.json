    "main event": "A USAF pilot spotted a diamond-shaped, flat, semi-transparent, and orange-colored object that was approximately the size of a fighter jet and was estimated to be traveling at a speed of 1,000 to 1,200 mph.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be under intelligent control, as it was able to change speed and direction without altering its altitude in relation to the horizon.",
        "The object left a trail behind it that was approximately 150 feet long and the width of the object.",
        "The pilot attempted to climb and gain a visual close on the object, but decided against it due to a shallow climb and lack of fuel.",
        "The object was described as triangular in form, with the outer edges appearing to be parallel and the front being translucent.",
        "The outer edges of the object appeared to change color and become translucent, as if there were a short distance behind the object."
