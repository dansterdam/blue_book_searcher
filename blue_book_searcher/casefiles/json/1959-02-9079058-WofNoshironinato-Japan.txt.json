  "main event": "On July 29, 1950, near Noshiro-Machi, Japan, a UFO was observed stationary, larger and brighter than a star, with illuminating colors, flickering on and off, and changing direction at intervals of 3-4 seconds. The visual observation lasted about 20 seconds.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed to change color and direction, flickering on and off, and appeared brighter every 3-4 seconds, with alternating colors of red, green, or blue.",
    "The UFO had no discernible tail or other appendages and was initially sighted due west of the pilots' course at an altitude of 15,000 feet.",
    "The pilots observed the UFO for several minutes before it turned away, increased speed, and disappeared, maintaining its altitude as the aircraft lost some altitude during the observation.",
    "Despite attempts by other pilots in the vicinity to paint the object on their scopes, they failed to do so, and the UFO seemed to maintain its altitude while the aircraft lost altitude.",
    "The object's behavior, including changing colors, flickering on and off, and altering course, puzzled the observers and led to attempts to identify it, including comparing its loss in altitude to a runway light."
