  "main event": "On January 17-18, 1956, in Wallkill, New York, a bright light resembling a star with the capability of helicopter-like motion was observed for 15 minutes before sailing out of sight below the horizon.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was initially described as a bright light occasionally twinkling, but then it displayed helicopter-like motion and moved to the northwest before disappearing below the horizon.",
    "The report mentioned that the first magnitude star Vega was in a specific direction, but the object was observed to the northwest, indicating a deviation from regular astronomical observations.",
    "It was concluded that the observation may have been a result of weather conditions causing distortion, and it was evaluated as an astronomical (Vega) case.",
    "The object was initially mistaken for a bright star due to its appearance, but it demonstrated unconventional movements, including up and down and side to side motions.",
    "The observer reported that for two succeeding nights, the same observation was made, indicating a recurring phenomenon."
