  "main event": "A UFO sighting was reported on August 12, 1959, at Ocean Beach, New Jersey, involving a red object resembling a searchlight in the sky. The object moved back and forth, changed in size, and emitted red and golden colors before fading out. It then orbited and went back and forth over the same area before fading out to the northeast over a 45-minute observation period.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as resembling a saucer from the side, about the size of a nickel held at arm's length, and turned golden at times.",

    "A high thin layer of stratus clouds was noted, and the observer mentioned the possibility of the strange light being reflected lights in a city.",
    "The report concludes that a preliminary analysis indicated a strong possibility that a weather balloon released from a nearby naval air station was in the vicinity of the observer at the time of the sighting.",
