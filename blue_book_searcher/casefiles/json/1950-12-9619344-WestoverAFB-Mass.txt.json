  "main event": "On 6 December 1950, an unidentified flying object was sighted near Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts, observed by a service man for Remington Rand Company in West Springfield. The object appeared as a silvery, glinting, half-moon shaped craft with a rounded edge pointing downward and no visible means of propulsion, control, or lights.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed at an altitude of 10,000 to 20,000 feet and appeared to maneuver without apparent reason at an estimated 25-degree angle above the horizon, exhibiting acceleration and flight capabilities far beyond known aircraft of the time.",
    "The observer, a member of the Air National Guard and an experienced aircraft mechanic, described the continuous whirling sound of the object as resembling a wind blowing over wires or jet propulsion.",
    "The observer was initially reluctant to provide details for fear of giving misleading information, and he requested no publicity, indicating sincerity in reporting the sighting.",
    "A T-33 jet aircraft from Westover AFB reported sighting an object in the vicinity of Newburyport, Massachusetts, during the same time as the observed UFO, although the details of the encounter are unknown.",
    "The Air Force interrogator's opinion was that the object was likely some type of reflecting light phenomenon and that the sound which attracted attention was not connected with the sighted object."
