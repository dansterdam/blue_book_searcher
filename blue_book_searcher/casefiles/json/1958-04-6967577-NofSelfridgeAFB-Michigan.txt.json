  "main event": "On 12 Apr 1958, north of Selfridge Air Force Base in Michigan, there were observations of two large and six small orange objects, with the six small objects coming out of the two large ones. They were seen traveling in pairs, emitting vapor trails, and moving from east to west. The duration of the sighting was approximately 2 minutes, but no photographs were taken.
