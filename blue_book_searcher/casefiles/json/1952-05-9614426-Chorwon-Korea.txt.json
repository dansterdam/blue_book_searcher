  "main event": "There were multiple sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in Chorwon, Korea in 1952. Witnesses reported various shapes, including a round, flat, silver, metallic object and a bright glowing object that appeared to be elliptical in shape, making no sound and exhibiting evasive maneuvers at high altitudes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "One report describes an object traveling at high speeds, climbing, and changing directions in a smooth flight with jerky movements, before fading from sight. Witnesses also noted rapid and evasive maneuvers that could not be matched by an F-84 propeller aircraft.",
    "A witness reported observing a bright light that pulsated from time to time, with an object estimated to be approximately 3500 feet high and making no sound.",
    "An observer noted a balloon-type object with a lighted object suspended from it, exhibiting glowing characteristics and a decreasing size as it descended to an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet.",
    "Some reports indicated a sighting of an object climbing vertically at high speed to approximately 10,000 feet before continuing west, possibly being mistaken for an F-86.",
    "A witness reported a sighting of a disc-shaped object that appeared to be the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length, traveling at an estimated speed of 25-30 knots and being tracked for approximately 15 minutes."
