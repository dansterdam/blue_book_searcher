  "main event": "On January 21, 1952, multiple sightings of a disc-shaped or pancake-shaped object were reported near Mitchell Air Force Base, New York. The object was described as metallic, 20-30 feet in diameter, and capable of high-speed maneuvers such as abrupt right-angle turns and rapid acceleration.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was sighted by multiple credible witnesses, including U.S. Navy pilot Lt Jg J.B. Reilly and the pilots of two F-94 type aircraft, who observed it maneuvering at high speeds.",
    "The object was capable of rapid acceleration, reaching speeds of approximately 400-500 knots and climbing to altitudes of 20-25 thousand feet in a matter of seconds.",
    "Despite initial assumptions of the object resembling a balloon, its abrupt right-angle turn and high-speed maneuvers were not consistent with balloon characteristics, leading to the conclusion that no other explanation could be determined at the time.",
    "The sightings caused apprehension among observers and were documented in official Air Intelligence Information Reports and communications from Mitchell AFB to the Eastern Air Defense Forces and the Air Technical Intelligence Center.",
    "A weather balloon release near Spokane, Washington on the same date was also documented, providing meteorological data for comparison with the UFO sightings."
