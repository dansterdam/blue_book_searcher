"main event": "On May 12, 1949, a civilian pilot flying from South Bend, Indiana to Indianapolis saw a metallic-looking object in the sky. The object appeared round, was glinting in the sunlight, and seemed to be moving faster than an airliner.",
"interesting points": [
	"The observer initially mistook the object for an airliner due to its size and appearance.",
	"The object's speed and size made it unlike any known aircraft at the time, ruling out the possibility of it being a conventional aircraft.",
	"The observer attempted to time the object's flight and estimated its approximate size based on comparisons to known objects and previous experiences.",
	"There was no physical evidence or further corroborating witnesses to the sighting, prompting the observer to decide to report the incident despite potential skepticism and lack of substantiating evidence.",
	"The observer suggested that the object he saw was approximately the size of, or slightly smaller than, the Graf Zeppelin and had a similar shape and polished aluminum appearance."
