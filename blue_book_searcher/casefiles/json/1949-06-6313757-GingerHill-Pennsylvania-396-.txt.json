  "main event": "A sighting of an unidentified aerial phenomenon was reported on 4th June 1949 at 10:15 AM near Ginger Hill, Pennsylvania. The witness observed an oval and very thin object flying at a 45-degree tilt at approximately 4000 feet altitude, twice the speed of conventional aircraft, and disappeared behind trees after approximately 30 seconds of observation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The witness described the object to be highly polished with no evidence of projections, lights, exhaust, or vaporization, and it made no sound.",
    "The object's shape was comparable to the wingspread of a two-engine plane, and its thickness was around 10% of its diameter.",
    "Witness was regarded as well-educated, level-headed, and of good character with no police record. The witness's ability to distinguish colors, speed of objects, and distances was attributed to their everyday work.",
    "The sighting was investigated by the United States Air Force and verified with weather reports from Allegheny County and Greater Pittsburgh Airport, confirming no flights in the vicinity at that time.",
    "The witness's brother, who was a passenger in the automobile at the time, did not see the object, adding an element of corroborative testimony."
