  "main event": "On June 24, 1953, in Hampton Bays, Long Island, New York, a slow, silver object, 20-30 feet in diameter, with a glowing, intense center section and several glowing rays or arms extending from the center section, was observed hovering stationary for over an hour. It discharged glowing balls of light and moved with a slow, gliding motion. The object did not make any sound and there were no exhaust flames or smoke visible. A smaller craft was dispatched from the larger one, returned, and then joined or was reabsorbed into the main craft as it sped away.",
