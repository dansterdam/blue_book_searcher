  "main event": "An oval-shaped object with a long tail and translucent, hazy color was observed in Kansas City, Missouri on September 25, 1958. The object was seen for 11 minutes and was later deemed as a balloon by the report.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as oval-shaped with a long, narrow tail and translucent, hazy color, approximately the size of a streetlight.",
    "The observation lasted for 11 minutes, providing a substantial amount of time for witnesses to see the object.",
    "Although the report indicates that the object was likely a balloon, it also states that there was insufficient data for evaluation.",
    "The sighting included details such as the observed object's course, duration, and comments attributing the object to a probable aircraft sighting.",
    "While the official conclusion labeled the object as a balloon, there were multiple possibilities considered including 'Was Balloon', 'Probably Balloon', 'Was Aircraft', and 'Probably Aircraft'."
