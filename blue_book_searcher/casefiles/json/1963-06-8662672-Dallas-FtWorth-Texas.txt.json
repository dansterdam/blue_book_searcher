    "main event": "Sixteen slides of objects were taken from an adjustment park known as \"Big dipper\" in Fort Worth, Texas. Photos taken in a local area between 1100 and 1200 hours showed several light spots.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The photos furnished to the source showed several light spots.",
        "Photo analysis of all slides indicated that the light spots were moving with the clouds, suggesting the objects were attached to the clouds.",
        "The report recommended no further physical analysis be performed, as the objects photographed were likely the same as those described in the attached letters.",
        "Additional information about the location and environmental conditions were requested to aid in understanding the nature of the objects photographed.",
        "There were two (2) photo pages of narrative included in the case file."
