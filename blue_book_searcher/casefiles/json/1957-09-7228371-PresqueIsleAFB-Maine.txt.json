  "main event": "On September 3, 1957, at Presque Isle AFB, Maine, a ground-visual observation was made of a round object that appeared to be spinning and zig-zagging. The length of the observation was 2 minutes, and the conclusion was inconclusive with possibilities of it being a balloon, astronomical sighting, or insufficient data for evaluation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The observed object was described as round, similar to the size of a silver dollar, and appeared to be spinning and zig-zagging in its movement.",
    "The observation lasted for 2 minutes, and the sighting took place at night with very dark and low clouds.",
    "Three different observers from the 23rd Fighter Group (Air Defense) reported the sighting, and one of the observers also noticed what appeared to be a star falling up.",
    "The observers saw a white light comparable to a star, and the object's flight path was described as straight, but zig-zagging left and right.",
    "There was also mention of a 60-watt bright light that eventually appeared to go out, possibly into the clouds."
