  "main event": "On 3 December 1957, the AF Reserve Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Griffiss AFB in New York reported a sighting of an unidentified flying object. The object appeared to be white or yellowish, did not exhibit high speed or rapid maneuvering, and its duration indicated the probability of it being a satellite or 'Sputnik' sighting.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The report described the object as appearing to have length and not twinkling, with fluctuating brilliance. It was observed to move from north to west at a fast speed, with no sound of jet exhaust heard.",
    "The object's trajectory was observed from 1958 EST, passing a bright star or planet in the west, and disappearing in the dimmer of two bright stars south of west at 1959 EST.",
    "The report ruled out the possibility of the object being Sputnik, as it exhibited different flight characteristics and speed compared to known satellites.",
    "The object was reported to be very distant and did not compare with other aircraft sightings in the area at the time.",
    "The report was forwarded to the Air Defense Command and the Air Technical Intelligence Center for further investigation."
