    "main event": "Unidentified flying objects were observed over Pueblo, Colorado and Fort Collins/Laramie, Colorado in August 1956.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects moved at very high speeds, estimated to be in excess of 1,000 mph, and were detected by both ground radar and visual confirmation.",
        "One object was described as round, the size of a basketball, with a solid bottom and green top, and appeared to be a weather balloon with a light attached.",
        "Another object was described as glowing bright red in the center with stars around it, and changed shape and direction over several nights, evading radar detection.",
        "Air Force spokesmen claimed the objects could have been balloons, but eyewitnesses stated they were larger and brighter than any balloons or stars.",
        "The recurrence of the Fort Collins object over several nights made a temperature inversion an unlikely explanation."
