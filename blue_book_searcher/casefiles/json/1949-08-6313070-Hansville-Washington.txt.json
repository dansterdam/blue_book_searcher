  "main event": "On August 28, 1949, near Hansville, Washington, four reliable eyewitnesses observed three flying discs at approximately 10,000 feet altitude. The objects were approximately 25-30 feet in diameter, made of very shiny metal, and appeared to be flat with no visible projections or moving parts. They made no sound and did not seem to be on any definite pattern or mission, fading from view after being observed for 1.5 to 2 minutes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The flying discs were observed for approximately 30 minutes over a 2-3 minute length of observation.",
    "The objects appeared to be tossing around, turning slowly, and fading from view, implying unconventional flight behavior.",
    "The weather at the time of the observation was clear with a visibility of at least 20 miles at 10,000 feet, and there were no scheduled flights or testing devices reported in the area during that time.",
    "One of the observers had previously observed what she believed to be flying discs near Yakima, Washington, a year before this incident.",
    "No visible exhaust, slots, duct openings, or jet openings were observed on the flying discs, and they did not appear to be controlled or stabilized in flight."
  ],
  "result": "The concluded explanation for the observation was 'BALLOON' as a large weather balloon was reported to have been released in the vicinity around the same time as the sighting.",
