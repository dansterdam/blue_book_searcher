Here is the JSON summary of the UFO report:

{
    "main event": "The USAF has determined that the transfer of the Aerial Phenomena Program, formerly conducted by AFOIN-4h, ATIC, is necessary due to the lack of evidence of any threat to national security or scientific/technical data of value to the Air Force.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The conducting of this program has resulted in considerable expense, and it has failed to reveal any threat to national security and has failed to provide any scientific or technical data of value to the Air Force.",
        "AFOIN has declined the transfer indicating that the data available is limited quantitatively only because of the volume of the material on hand, but no scientific/technical value was to be exploited fully.",
        "The data obtained during the course of this project is valuable to the Air Force only as statistics and as they relate to the public relations aspects of the program.",
        "The Air Force must be concerned in view of the fact that this program, for the most part, deals with public relations and the military's association with the program.",
        "To prevent the loss of valuable information, an individual with a technical background in astronomy and geology at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory is suggested to be recruited to review the reports for potential intelligence or scientific value."
