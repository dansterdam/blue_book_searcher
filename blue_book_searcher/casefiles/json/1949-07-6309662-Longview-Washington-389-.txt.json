  "main event": "Multiple identical disc-shaped objects were sighted over Longview, Washington on July 3, 1949, with observations made by credible witnesses including an aeronautical engineer, retired Navy pilot, and others, at an altitude of approximately 30,000 feet, and displaying regular oscillations as well as uniform circular motion.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects were observed to have a regular, oscillating motion, timed at approximately 48 oscillations per minute, described as a result of 'skulling or falling leaf motion' rather than a conventional axis-based movement.",
    "The observations were made by a variety of witnesses, including persons of authority such as aeronautical engineers, pilots, and members of the general public, totaling approximately 150 individuals present during an air show at the time of the sighting.",
    "The observer, an aeronautical engineer, mentioned having experience with pilotless aircraft and guided missile programs, and confidently asserted that the observed objects were unlike any conventional aircraft, balloons, or known objects.",
    "A local stunt pilot and an aeronautical engineer from Longview, Washington, concurred with the observer's descriptions and were in agreement regarding the unprecedented nature of the observed objects.",
    "An effort was made to obtain simultaneous observations and additional data from reputable witnesses and aviation professionals, including the attempt to triangulate for the course and altitude of the objects."
