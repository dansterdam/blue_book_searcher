        "The observation lasted for less than 28 minutes and involved a single intense white light object at a high altitude.",
        "The object exhibited rapid and evasive maneuvering, veering in response to the pilot's movements before disappearing at high speed.",
        "No sound or markings were detected on the object, and there were no radar reports about the sighting.",
        "The object's speed was estimated to be 4-5 times the true airspeed of the pilot's aircraft.",
        "The object's disappearance towards the Ft Worth-Waco area adds geographical context to the sighting."
