        "There were 2 photographs and 5 pieces of physical evidence collected, implying a more tangible encounter than a mere visual sighting.",
        "The conclusion drawn was that the objects were probably astronomical in nature, specifically identified as meteors, which is a reasonable explanation.",
        "The report contained 4 separate reports from 4 different sources, adding credibility to the observation.",
        "The described streaks of white light extinguishing quickly align with the typical behavior of Lyrid meteors."
