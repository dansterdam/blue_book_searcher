    "main event": "An orange colored object, triangular in shape, was sighted about 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon. It glowed and had a blue-green tinge, remained stationary to the northwest, and disappeared within 20 seconds.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The angular velocity indicates the object was at a considerable distance.",
        "The object was viewed through 20% cloud cover, so details were not distinct for an accurate estimation.",
        "Another sighting described the object as round or ovate, the size of a volleyball at arm's length, and red or orange-red in color.",
        "The object was described as egg-shaped with a point down and a bright spot near the base, and as triangular when viewed through a 30-power telescope.",
        "Neither a hot air balloon with a fire nor the re-entry and burning-up of a Soviet moon shot seemed to satisfactorily explain the sightings, and there was no physical evidence."
