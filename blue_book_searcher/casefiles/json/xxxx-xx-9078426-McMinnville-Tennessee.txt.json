    "interesting points": [
        "The objects would become larger and smaller in size, and appear to be maneuvering, moving rapidly up and down and darting about in seemingly unnatural motions.",
        "The objects continued in an apparent erratic course, moving up, down, and from side to side, rather than in a straight line.",
        "When the objects would seemingly disappear, they would reappear almost instantly at another point in the sky.",
        "The witnesses could not hear any sound associated with the objects.",
        "The objects appeared to be solid, metallic objects, reflecting light, and would have passed for very large jets at great distance but for the odd, jerky motions they displayed."
