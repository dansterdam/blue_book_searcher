    "main event": "On December 15, 1952, in Hartsville, South Carolina, an Air Force pilot reported sighting a circular silver object in the sky for 10-15 seconds, which appeared to oscillate, change altitude erratically, and travel at approximately 600 mph.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object appeared to be half the size of the distance it was observed at, suggesting a significant size.",
        "It was described as oscillating, changing altitude, and displaying erratic speed, behavior not characteristic of conventional aircraft.",
        "The sighting took place at night during clear weather, allowing for better visibility and observation.",
        "The object was not identified as any known conventional aerial vehicle, such as a meteor or balloon.",
        "The witness was an Air Force pilot, a credible observer with training and experience in identifying aircraft."
