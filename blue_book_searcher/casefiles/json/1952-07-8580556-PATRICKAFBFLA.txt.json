    "Several flying objects were observed by credible witnesses, including aircraft maintenance personnel, control tower operators, and pilots from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.",
    "The objects were reported to appear like a great star of amber color and exhibited erratic movements, such as reversing course without apparent turning.",
    "Witnesses reported the objects as moving at high speeds, with one object estimated to be flying at a speed in excess of 700 mph at an altitude of 20,000 feet.",
    "A strange light in the sky was observed to fluctuate in intensity, move erratically, and then shoot off rapidly towards the Southeast, leaving no trail in the sky.",
