  "main event": "A farmer found an instrument on his farm in Danforth, Illinois in August 1947, which burned the weeds around the area upon landing. The instrument was analyzed and found to have no connection with the so-called 'Flying Saucers' or any projects at Wright Field. It was considered to be part of a hoax for publicity or other reasons.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The instrument landed in the middle of a section of the farmer's farm land and burned weeds 2 feet tall to ash in an area of 18 feet in diameter around where the object dropped.",
    "The instrument consisted of various items including a plaster of paris body with an oval cavity, a power microphone with the name 'Nathaniel Baldwin Inc.' on it, a small 'Polymat' filter condenser, bakelite cylinders with fine copper wires, and a piece of metal with magnetic properties.",
    "Specimens from the instrument included fragments of an undeterminable shape made from plaster of paris, outmoded type of magnetic speaker diaphragm, bakelite coil forms, and a metallic box, among others.",
    "The coils found in the instrument were skillfully made at one time but were later crudely rewrapped by someone not familiar with the art of making a coil. These coils also had no connection with any Air Materiel Command (AMC) project.",
    "The items were intentionally or unintentionally damaged or obtained from scrap, and no connection whatsoever could be made between these items and the so-called 'Flying Saucers'."
