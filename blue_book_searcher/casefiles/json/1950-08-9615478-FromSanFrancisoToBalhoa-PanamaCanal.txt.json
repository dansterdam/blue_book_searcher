        "In August 1959, several Japanese and one U.S. CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) agent reported sighting unidentified objects that appeared to be flying saucers at an altitude of around 2,000 feet near Niigata, Japan. The objects changed color from yellow to blue to red, separated into two parts, and made a hissing noise before fading out.",
