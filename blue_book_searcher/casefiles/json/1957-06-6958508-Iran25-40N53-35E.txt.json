  "main event": "Several UFO sightings were reported in different locations like Iran and the United States. One report from Shahrokhi AFB in Iran described a bright, opalescent light traversing the sky, lasting for approximately 5-7 seconds and appearing elliptical in shape, with clear white light, at times pulsating. Another report from Tehran, Iran, involved two F-86 Sabre jet interceptors witnessing a round, brilliant white light at approximately 25,000 feet which emitted rays of colored lights, rapidly changing colors, and then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view.",
