    "The witness in Ohio reported that the object suddenly disappeared, leaving a 'short, squat trail' and looking like a 'worm squirming'.",
    "The sighting in Idaho involved a reliable observer witnessing a luminous disc-shaped object, approximately 50 feet in diameter, hovering at a low altitude for 10-15 minutes before ascending rapidly and disappearing from sight.",
    "The Idaho witness mentioned that the object gave off a bright glow and left no physical evidence, and the Air Force was unable to identify the object.",
