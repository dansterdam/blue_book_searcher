  "main event": "On 15 August 1949 in Seattle, Washington, a mail carrier observed four silver, oval-shaped objects flying in a V formation for about 10 seconds before disappearing behind clouds.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The objects had a 3 to 1 ratio of length to width and appeared to be very high and far away.",
    "There was no evidence of smoke or vapor trails, no sound, and no apparent support or propulsion for the objects.",
    "The witness, a former aviation machinist in the United States Navy, considered the possibility that the objects could have been airplanes, although he was not familiar with new types of jet aircraft.",
    "Another witness, a student, was unable to see the objects due to a tree blocking her view, but the mail carrier did not appear overly excited about the sighting.",
    "No physical evidence or photographs were obtained, and the conclusion of the investigation was that the observed objects were likely aircraft, possibly jet planes."
