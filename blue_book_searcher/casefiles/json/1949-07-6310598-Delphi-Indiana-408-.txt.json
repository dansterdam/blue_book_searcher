They emitted a phosphorescent glare as they approached and were highly maneuverable.",
"interesting points": [
	"The objects were observed for approximately four hours, during which they exhibited erratic flying patterns and emitted a phosphorescent glare as they approached the observers.",

	"Several powerful searchlights were seen to sweep the sky following the objects, likely belonging to the police or fire department.",
	"The observers stated that they were not imaginative or under the influence of any substances, and their observations were made in full possession of their faculties.",
