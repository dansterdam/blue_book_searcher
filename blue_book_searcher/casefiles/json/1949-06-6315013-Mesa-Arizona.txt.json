    "main event": "On 24 June 1949, in Mesa, Arizona, a civilian observed the sighting of four metallic, steel-gray flying discs, which appeared to hover around a small cloud at an extremely high altitude. A fifth disc later appeared at a lower altitude, moving from west to east, sustaining observation for about 30 minutes.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The discs were observed to have varied forms depending on the position they were viewed from, appearing rectangular in some positions.",
        "One of the discs proceeded in a smooth direct course to the southeast, while another moved straight east, and a third went northeast. The fifth object appeared in the west and moved eastwards.",
        "The objects were estimated to have a maximum speed of 400 miles per hour, and no sound emanated from them.",
        "Witnesses included credible individuals, such as a World War II aircraft gunnery instructor and the supervisor of a water association in Mesa, Arizona.",
        "The civilian observer was noted to be emotionally inclined, but his descriptions were precise and consistent. He claimed to be an amateur astronomer with his own telescope."
