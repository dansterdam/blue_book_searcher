"main event": "The documents consist of various reports of unidentified radar targets and flying objects picked up on radar scopes at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the period of 17-30 November 1950. The reports caused considerable alarm to personnel charged with the security of the area.",
"interesting points": [
    "Anomalous propagation was suggested as the cause of the unusual radar returns, referring to the bending downward of radar beams due to non-uniformity of the atmosphere in density or moisture content, commonly known as 'temperature inversion'",
    "The radar picked up numerous targets, with conflicting observations about their movement and disappearance, leading to uncertainty about their nature and characteristics.",
    "Unexplained and unknown radar targets fluctuated in intensity and were reported to be moving at 6 to 8 miles per hour, with ground clutter extending on the radar echoes in certain directions.",
    "Photographs of the radar scopes were recommended to be taken during unusual radar return conditions to provide a true representation of the events.",
    "Intercept aircraft were dispatched but were unable to intercept any of the unknown targets, and the targets did not appear on the airborne radar set, leading to further mystery about their nature."
