        "The object was approximately 50-75 feet above the ground and appeared to be the size of an aircraft wing light.",
        "The object accelerated rapidly down the runway, moving so fast that the observer was unable to use his field glasses to get a better look.",
        "The object then veered southwest and climbed, with the light sustained and not blinking, although it appeared to move up and down slightly.",
        "The sighting lasted for about 3 seconds, with the object turning and climbing during the last second.",
        "No other unusual activity or aircraft was reported in the area that could account for the sighting."
