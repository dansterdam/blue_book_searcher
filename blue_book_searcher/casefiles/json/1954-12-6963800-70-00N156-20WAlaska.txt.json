  "main event": "A B-47 crew reported sighting a UFOB while flying in bomber formation in the vicinity of 71-00N 156-20N at 30,000ft in Alaska on December 12, 1954. The object appeared oval, blinking pinkish-red for 15 minutes, then turned steady white for 15 minutes before dissipating with the approach of daylight after 45 minutes of intermittent observation.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The UFOB was initially mistaken for an interceptor aircraft making a pass at the bomber formation.",
    "It appeared to be a celestial body or a reflection of such, without a discernible material substance, and could easily be mistaken as a fighter-type aircraft at first sight.",
    "The crew reported the object's transition of colors and relative position with the bomber formation, leading them to believe it was obviously a celestial body.",
    "The observing pilot initially thought the steady white light was a planet in the same relative position of the other objects.",
    "The report was prepared by Captain Marquis H. N. Dyers and Captain Robert E. Nys, the aircraft commander and pilot, respectively."
