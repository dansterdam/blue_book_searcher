  "main event": "On 29 August 1952 in Brooklyn, New York, a bright fiery red light in the sky was reported, visible for 5-6 minutes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was described as having a delta wing configuration, similar to the silhouette of some later military jet aircraft but slower than a jet.",
    "The object emitted a secondary color, generally a blue-green color, and then had a red glow as it went up and down rapidly.",
    "The witness noted that the object did not appear to be a jet, as it was flying too slow and had no wings.",
    "The observation lasted for around 10-15 minutes and the object was smaller than a jet airliner but larger than an average aircraft.",
    "A letter from a witness provided detailed information and was referred to Project Blue Book for further investigation."
