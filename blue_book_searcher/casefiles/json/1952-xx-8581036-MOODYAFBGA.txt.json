  "main event": "On July 23, 1952, an airman stationed at Moody Air Force Base observed about five unusual flying objects. The first object was observed to change colors from red to dull white to green, and then to bright orange, before remaining stationary. The other objects appeared to be white in color and traveled in different directions before disappearing. The witness observed the objects for approximately one hour and fifteen minutes.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The UFOs were observed to travel at extremely high speeds and change colors, including a white flash appearing near one of the objects.",
    "One of the objects remained completely stationary and changed colors from blue to red while stationary.",
    "The witness had difficulty determining the shape, size, and speed of the objects, and could not provide additional information about his background and practical experience on which his reliability could be judged.",
    "The report includes confirmation from the AACS Detachment that approximately twelve aircraft were airborne in the general area of the sighting between the hours of 2030 and 2145 hours on July 23, 1952.",
    "The Source was a high school graduate and a flight clerk at the Moody Air Force Base."
