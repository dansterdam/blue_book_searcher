    "main event": "Multiple kidney-shaped objects with a steady fluorescent glow were observed moving rapidly in a 'W' formation over Mesa, Arizona.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were estimated to be around 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, with a formation of 15-20 objects.",
        "The objects moved in a straight line at an approximate speed of 600 knots before disappearing behind a house.",
        "The observer initially thought the objects were a flight of geese, but upon reflection described them as 'V disk shaped'.",
        "The investigating officer suggested possible explanations such as light reflecting from a flight of birds or bats, a meteor shower, a tanker with its refueling lights on, or a large aircraft with its landing light on.",
        "The most plausible explanation given was that the sighting was likely a large aircraft with its landing light on."
