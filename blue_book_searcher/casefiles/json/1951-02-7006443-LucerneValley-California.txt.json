        "The objects were silvery, aluminum, metallic, and brighter than a white cloud, but did not give off any radiation.",
        "There were initially two objects moving in opposite directions, which then stopped their forward motion and turned around in an 'end-over-end' maneuver.",
        "A third object was later sighted, which appeared to shorten and thicken when in a vertical position before moving in the opposite direction.",
        "The objects were estimated to be at least 14 miles distant and moving at over 400 mph, but the observers could not gauge the exact distance or speed.",
        "No sound was reported from the objects, and no physical evidence or photographs were obtained."
