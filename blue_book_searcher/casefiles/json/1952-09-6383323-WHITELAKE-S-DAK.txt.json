    "main event": "Multiple sightings of a brightly burning 'stick' or 'ball' over White Lake, South Dakota in September 1952, observed for 30 to 40 minutes by a Ground Observer Corps post supervisor and several others in the area. The object appeared to maneuver, hover, change brightness, and split into two parts at one point. It moved erratically and at a rapid rate of speed before finally disappearing from sight.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object was described as 'white or ledge shaped' with a longitudinal axis parallel, about 30-45 feet in diameter, and made no noise. It moved at about 100 mph at an altitude of 5,000-7,000 feet and at times hovered, becoming more distinct.",
        "The observation was made through 'high power' binoculars, and the civilian observer specifically requested no publicity be given to his name.",
        "The object appeared to be at an estimated altitude of approximately 10,000 feet and moved in an erratic manner, displaying rapid speed and hovering in one position before disappearing.",
        "No physical evidence of the object was available, and no interception or identification action was taken.",
