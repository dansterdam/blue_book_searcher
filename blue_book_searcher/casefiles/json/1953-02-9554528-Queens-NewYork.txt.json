  "main event": "On February 23, 1953, a person in New York observed a yellow-orange tinged brilliant light at an altitude between 10-15 degrees above the horizon, approximately the size of a star. Its apparent motion indicated a downward path descending in angle from about 20 degrees to approximately 10 degrees, remaining in view for approximately 15 seconds. It apparently instantaneously disappeared.",
  "interesting points": [
    "The object was observed by two witnesses at ground level and appeared to be disc-shaped, illuminated, and of yellowish-green color.",
    "The object moved rapidly and silently, rising and disappearing, covering sixty degrees of angular traverse during the time it was observed.",
    "No recognizable shape was described due to the considerable distance of the object and it was estimated to be three to four times the size of the star 'Polaris'.",
    "The witness stated that he had observed the same object the previous day, describing its color as an off-yellow with an orange tinge and very brilliant.",
    "The individual who observed the object was experienced in observing aircraft but found this object 'not familiar as any known aircraft'."
