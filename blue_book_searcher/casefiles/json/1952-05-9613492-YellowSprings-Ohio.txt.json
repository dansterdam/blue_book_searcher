    "main event": "On May 14, 1952, a senior college student observed an elliptical object with a dull brownish-green glow in Yellow Springs, Ohio. The object was silent, moved at double the speed of a jet, and had a constant glow while in the observer's line of vision for 4-5 seconds.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The object's size appeared to be that of a half-moon from the observer's perspective.",
        "It moved at double the speed of a jet traveling at the same altitude, suggesting a high velocity.",
        "The elliptical object emitted a dull brownish-green light with a well-defined glow around the edges.",
        "The observer described the shape of the object as similar to a complete circle with the forward edge tilted upward in a climbing position, resulting in the observed half-moon effect.",
        "The absence of sound and any tails or trails, the clear night with no clouds, and the specific behavior of the glow around the edges make the sighting particularly unusual."
