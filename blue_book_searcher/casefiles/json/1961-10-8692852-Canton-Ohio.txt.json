        "The object was observed by the station crew and described as a 'brilliantly glowing object' that was moving erratically and fluctuating in brightness.",
        "The observers initially thought the object must be less distant than it seemed and went out by car to get a closer look, but the mystery was solved when they approached the area.",
        "A plantation manager and his servant also observed the object from a field, and it was determined that the 'glowing object' was actually a lighted pressure lantern.",
        "On October 8, 1961, Walter S. Dornfeld and John D. Drazba investigated a UFO report in Canton, Ohio. The object was described as being about 50 feet in diameter and 15-20 feet thick, with flashing lights around its perimeter and a bright light on the underside.",
