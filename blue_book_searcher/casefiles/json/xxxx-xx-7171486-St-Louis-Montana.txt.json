    "main event": "An observer reported seeing a bright light that descended rapidly from an altitude of about 3,000 feet. The light then appeared to oscillate or 'dance' in the sky for around 5 minutes before disappearing in an erratic fashion.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The light was described as being several times brighter than the brightest star.",
        "The light initially appeared round in shape, then took on a cigar-like shape and turned bright red.",
        "The observer stated they heard absolutely no sound from the object, even though they felt they should have been able to hear the sound of an aircraft at that altitude.",
        "The report mentions the object appeared to lose altitude and swoop down to around 200 feet above the observer's house before rapidly accelerating and disappearing.",
        "The observer provided a detailed sketch showing the object's trajectory and estimated altitude changes."
