    "interesting points": [
        "The object was initially the size of a cigarette butt at arm's length, then grew larger after the apparent explosion.",
        "The object emitted a brilliant white light until after the explosion, when it turned a very vivid green color that persisted for about 15 seconds before fading to a white light.",
        "The object seemed to turn up about 10 degrees above the horizon.",
        "The witness's wife first noticed the bright light and woke him up to see the object.",
        "The report concludes that the object was likely a type of meteor called a bolide, which was apparently very large and persisted longer than usual."
