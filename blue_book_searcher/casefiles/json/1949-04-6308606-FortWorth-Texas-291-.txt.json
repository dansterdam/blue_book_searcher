  "main event": "An unidentified flying object was seen over Fort Worth, Texas on 13 April 1949, traveling at a tremendous speed estimated to be over 1000 miles per hour before suddenly disappearing. The object was described as a bright silver round ball traveling horizontally in the direction of south-south-east, with an exhaust trail three times the size of the object.",

    "The object was estimated to be traveling at a speed far in excess of any known aircraft or meteor, indicating an unusual and unexplained phenomenon.",
    "The sighting lasted for approximately 8 seconds and the object was also observed by other eyewitnesses, adding credibility to the report.",
    "The exhaust trail of the object appeared to originate from a perfect circle in the rear of the object, suggesting a distinct and structured design.",
    "No sound was heard during the observation, and the weather conditions at the time were reported as clear with 8 miles visibility, ruling out atmospheric disturbances as a possible cause.",
    "The observers were noted to be of above-average intelligence and sound character, providing credibility to the reported sighting."
