        "The object was rotating and disappeared behind a hill.",
        "The observer compared the object's profile to a jet aircraft in a holding pattern at a distance of 15-20 miles.",
        "The object's attitude corresponded to a heading of 330 degrees at an altitude of 28,000 feet, matching a Utility Flight Military flight that occurred in the area.",
        "The 'eruptions' described were likely reflections off of light falling snow in the area.",
        "The observer was in a moving vehicle, and the relative positions of the car and aircraft could have caused the object to appear stationary."
