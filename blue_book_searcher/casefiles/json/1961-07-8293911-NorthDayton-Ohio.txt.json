    "main event": "Eight bright, white, rectangular-shaped objects were observed hovering in the sky over North Dayton, Ohio on July 16, 1961 for 1.5 hours.",
    "interesting points": [
        "The objects were estimated to be at an altitude of 6,000-8,000 feet.",
        "The objects moved slowly and remained stationary for the entire 1.5-hour observation period, which is unusual behavior.",
        "The sighting was made by multiple witnesses, which the report describes as an \"excellent sighting\".",
        "The objects did not make any noise or leave any trails, and their description does not fit that of a typical astronomical phenomenon like a satellite cluster.",
        "No definite conclusion could be drawn about the nature of the unidentified objects at the time of the report."
